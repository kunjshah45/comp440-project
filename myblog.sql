(11, 'It\'s make or break time for artificial intelligence.', 'kunjshah45', 'artificial-intelligence-will-make-or-break-us', '<p>Artificial Intelligence is the next technological frontier, and it has the potential to make or break the world order. The AI revolution could pull the &ldquo;bottom billion&rdquo; out of poverty and transform dysfunctional institutions, or it could entrench injustice and increase inequality. The outcome will depend on how we manage the coming changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to managing technological revolutions, humanity has a rather poor track record. Consider the Internet, which has had an enormous impact on societies worldwide, changing how we communicate, work, and occupy ourselves. And it has disrupted some economic sectors, forced changes to long-established business models, and created a few entirely new industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Internet has not brought the kind of comprehensive transformation that many anticipated. It certainly didn&rsquo;t resolve the big problems, such as eradicating poverty or <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/429690/why-we-cant-solve-big-problems/\" target=\"_blank\">enabling</a> us to reach Mars. As PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel once noted: &ldquo;We wanted flying cars; instead, we got 140 characters.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, in some ways, the Internet has exacerbated our problems. While it has created opportunities for ordinary people, it has created even more opportunities for the wealthiest and most powerful. A <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/website-archive/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2016/02/Internet--social-inequalities.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">recent study</a> by researchers at the LSE reveals that the Internet has increased inequality, with educated, high-income people deriving the greatest benefits online and multinational corporations able to grow massively &ndash; while evading accountability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps, though, the AI revolution can deliver the change we need. Already, AI &ndash; which focuses on advancing the cognitive functions of machines so that they can &ldquo;learn&rdquo; on their own &ndash; is reshaping our lives. It has delivered self-driving (though still not flying) cars, as well as virtual personal assistants and even autonomous weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this barely scratches the surface of AI&rsquo;s potential, which is likely to produce societal, economic, and political transformations that we cannot yet fully comprehend. AI will not become a new industry; it will penetrate and permanently alter every industry in existence. AI will not change human life; it will change the boundaries and meaning of being human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How and when this transformation will happen &ndash; and how to manage its far-reaching effects &ndash; are questions that keep scholars and policymakers up at night. Expectations for the AI era range from visions of paradise, in which all of humanity&rsquo;s problems have been solved, to fears of dystopia, in which our creation becomes an existential threat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making predictions about scientific breakthroughs is notoriously difficult. On September 11, 1933, the famed nuclear physicist Lord Rutherford <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602776/yes-we-are-worried-about-the-existential-risk-of-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\">told a large audience</a>, &ldquo;Anyone who looks for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms is talking moonshine.&rdquo; The next morning, Leo Szilard hypothesized the idea of a neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction; soon thereafter, he patented the nuclear reactor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem, for some, is the assumption that new technological breakthroughs are incomparable to those in the past. Many scholars, pundits, and practitioners would agree with Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt that technological phenomena have their own intrinsic properties, which humans &ldquo;don&rsquo;t understand&rdquo; and should not &ldquo;mess with.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others may be making the opposite mistake, placing too much stock in historical analogies. The technology writer and researcher <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/evgeny-morozov\" target=\"_blank\">Evgeny Morozov</a>, among others, expects some degree of path dependence, with current discourses shaping our thinking about the future of technology, thereby influencing technology&rsquo;s development. Future technologies could subsequently impact our narratives, creating a sort of self-reinforcing loop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To think about a technological breakthrough like AI, we must find a balance between these approaches. We must adopt an interdisciplinary perspective, underpinned by an agreed vocabulary and a common conceptual framework. We also need policies that address the interconnections among technology, governance, and ethics. Recent initiatives, such as <a href=\"https://www.partnershiponai.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Partnership on AI</a> or <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/press/releases/knight-foundation-omidyar-network-and-linkedin-founder-reid-hoffman-create-27-million-fund-to-research-artificial-intelligence-for-the-public-interest\" target=\"_blank\">Ethics and Governance of AI Fund</a> are a step in the right direction, but lack the necessary government involvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These steps are necessary to answer some fundamental questions: What makes humans human? Is it the pursuit of hyper-efficiency &ndash; the &ldquo;Silicon Valley&rdquo; mindset? Or is it irrationality, imperfection, and doubt &ndash; traits beyond the reach of any non-biological entity?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only by answering such questions can we determine which values we must protect and preserve in the coming AI age, as we rethink the basic concepts and terms of our social contracts, including the national and international institutions that have allowed inequality and insecurity to proliferate. In a context of far-reaching transformation, brought about by the rise of AI, we may be able to reshape the <em>status quo</em>, so that it ensures greater security and fairness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the keys to creating a more egalitarian future relates to data. Progress in AI relies on the availability and analysis of large sets of data on human activity, online and offline, to distinguish patterns of behavior that can be used to guide machine behavior and cognition. Empowering all people in the age of AI will require each individual &ndash; not major companies &ndash; to own the data they create.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the right approach, we could ensure that AI empowers people on an unprecedented scale. Though abundant historical evidence casts doubt on such an outcome, perhaps doubt is the key. As the late sociologist Zygmunt Bauman put it, &ldquo;questioning the ostensibly unquestionable premises of our way of life is arguably the most urgent of services we owe our fellow humans and ourselves.&rdquo;</p>\r\n', '2019-11-23 03:03:28', 48),
(13, 'A Simple Solution to Poor Office Communication', 'kunjshah45', 'a-simple-solution-to', 'How about this: Sit everyone down and tell them to stop complaining — they should be jumping for joy that you’re all still in business! Remind them that if they were working harder they wouldn’t have time to complain. Then end everything in a team cheer (but a fast one, because people need to stop yapping and get back to work).\r\nMore seriously, you’re facing a common problem for companies of your size. Back when you ran a smaller company, there was no need for company-wide emails and meetings to keep people aligned. You all worked in the same room, and spoke daily and company direction could largely be absorbed by the employees through osmosis.\r\nBut now that approach isn’t working. You’ve brought on staff who you’re not necessarily in touch with each day, and they’re saying they don’t understand the bigger picture, or perhaps even what their colleagues in other departments are doing. Meanwhile, your earliest employees aren’t sure what has changed about the initial vision, which continues, rightly or wrongly, to guide their own decision-making.\r\nAt this point you should be doing some kind of company all-hands at least once a month (ideally more frequently than this). You don’t need a fancy PowerPoint presentation or any prepped material (that’s always nice, but let’s be realistic). The point is to get up and give an overview of where the business is, what big highlights (and challenges) you’ve faced over the past month, and where things are headed. You’ve got a roadmap, right? Pull that out and show people how you are tracking. Come back to that roadmap or overall plan again and again.\r\nThis approach is obviously helpful for keeping your team aligned, but it also has other benefits: It’s motivating for people to understand how the company is moving forward, and if you’ve hit a rough patch, it’s helpful for them to understand the roadblocks that are slowing you down.\r\nIf you can swing doing this every week or every two weeks, even better. Even if you’re just giving a five-minute overview, then taking questions, that’s still a valuable half hour of time in which you will manage to hit all your employees in one go. Bonuses: your employees will see you as human; they’ll have a chance to get answers to questions their own manager may not be able to answer; and they are reminded, as they sit and share drinks and snacks with others, that they are part of a bigger team and a grand plan.\r\nThe point is that each team should be giving a snapshot of what they are doing and how it relates to the overall business.\r\nPlay with the structure of your all-hands, and if employees are receptive, see how you can expand the content of the session now and then to help bridge the potential disconnect between different teams. Make your engineering team “own” one all-hands, where they get 10 minutes to present what they are doing. The marketing and communications folks get the following month, and your sales people the next. The content matters, but it doesn’t need to be perfect. The point is that each team should be giving a snapshot of what they are doing and how it relates to the overall business — and just as importantly, giving some guidance as to how they can help or when they should be looped in on something. This is obviously also a great way for people to learn about people outside their departments.\r\nThere are plenty of other things you can look at — for example, company-wide emails to celebrate big successes, a quarterly presentation with updates on the business, and a regular check-in with your non-technical teams to understand their blind spots and broader plans.\r\nOne final note: A retreat doesn’t count. I’ve often been struck by the number of start-ups I know that are great about taking their companies on Napa or Cabo boondoggles, but don’t have basic company-wide meetings in place. Sure, giving your employees a chance to connect at a winery or beach bar is a lot of fun (and full of potential HR infractions!) but it’s not a replacement for ensuring that employees have the information they need to do their jobs. And here’s a bonus: you’re less likely to end up with a lawsuit from a company all-hands than from that boozy winery trip!', '2019-10-17 18:57:24', 8),

(21, 'How to Learn to Code and Get Your First Job', 'kunjshah', 'learning-to-code-your-first-job', '<p>How I Learned to Code and Got My First Job</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My coding journey began about two and a half years ago, and I started working my first full-time developer job recently (wooo!). This might seem like a long time for some of you, but I didn&#39;t rush it and wasn&#39;t trying to find work until two months ago. Many people have done it more quickly and I was probably ready for a while. So I&#39;ve decided to share my story, my resources, and what worked for me when learning web development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How I got interested in coding</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was living in Thailand, training and fighting Muay Thai while working about 10 hours a week as a social media manager. I wasn&#39;t really enjoying marketing as a career and it wasn&#39;t as flexible as I wished, since I needed to be active at certain hours of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily I had the time to learn something new. I&#39;d looked at a few things online which sounded like good skills to have that were flexible and that could be done remotely. But it wasn&#39;t until I met a guy traveling through Vietnam, who was working as a web developer, that I was intrigued and started to play around a little bit with coding.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where To Learn?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, I was jumping around trying out different sites such as Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and others I can&#39;t recall. I never really got anywhere with these to start with but they got me interested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After researching, I decided to take CS50 - Introduction To Computer Science, a famous Harvard course run by David Malan. It teaches the real basics of computer science such as data structures, algorithms, and the relevant workings of a computer. This is all done in C but the basics you learn and the confidence you build apply to every language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I completed CS50 I started on freeCodeCamp. What I loved about freeCodeCamp most was the projects. They give you great ideas to practice and test your skills as you are learning. Once I got through the first couple of sections on HTML/CSS/JavaScript and onto more advanced topics, I didn&#39;t find the lessons thorough enough. So I ditched them for Udemy courses which went more in depth on a topic. Then I could go back and build the freeCodeCamp projects for practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used this combination of Udemy and freeCodeCamp until I had a solid grasp of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, and Redux. I also completed all of the projects on freeCodeCamp except for the data visualisation section using D3.js, as I didn&#39;t find this skill in demand when looking at jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I was confident in these skills, I still hadn&#39;t gotten involved in open source except for a couple of tiny pull requests. I simply didn&#39;t know where to get started. Every time I looked at issues I couldn&#39;t see anything interesting. Or those that were interesting had already been claimed by someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, I got involved with freeCodeCamp as a contributor. I would recommend just making a habit of checking the issues once a week or so to see if there&#39;s something that you want to help with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with my work with open source, I also got an internship as a front-end developer focused on React. It wasn&#39;t the ideal internship but it was remote and I learned a lot by working on a codebase someone else had built. I was the only dev on the front-end. This presented it&#39;s own challenges, like being given a problem and being responsible for researching and solving it. In this time, I learned about and implemented internationalisation as well as React Native.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Getting the Job</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a strong mix of skills, projects and experience to show off, my r&eacute;sum&eacute; in hand, and a portfolio site promoting my work. I was ready!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting the job was mostly a game of patience. All together it took me 2 months of searching and applying every day to jobs. Most of the time I didn&#39;t hear back. I applied for a lot of jobs which were looking for mid level developers or more experience than I had, which didn&#39;t work out. Most of the jobs I found on job boards were advertised by recruiters and I found these the most fruitful. I often received a call and meeting with recruiters who were impressed by my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and skills and were looking for junior roles for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was also attending meetups to network and look for jobs. I didn&#39;t find any roles directly, as the companies weren&#39;t looking for juniors. However, I did meet a recruiter at a React meetup whom I grabbed coffee with the next week. He had a role from a company that was open to juniors and this is where I ended up accepting a position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hiring process for this position consisted of a tech test (https://github.com/GlynL/tech-test-prendi), and then an interview where I was actually offered the job at the end. It&#39;s a great small company where I&#39;m working with the senior developer and can bounce ideas and get help when I need it. It&#39;s a full-stack job, I get to use React daily, and I will get the chance to work with a lot of technologies as projects require them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was interviewing, the thing that people appreciated most was that I had worked on a real application in an internship. Even if I could have done everything in a personal project it proved that I could work on a real world application with other people. I would certainly recommend seeking out internships as this will look great on your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and will be a talking point during interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What would I do differently?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If I were to do it all over again, there&#39;s a couple of things I would do differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, I would get more involved with open source projects much earlier on. There&#39;s always something you can contribute to a project even if you are still learning HTML and CSS. You may have to be more particular about the issues you pick up but you can definitely help! The skills you gain in navigating a large codebase and working with others are invaluable. And as you learn more you can pick more complex issues to match your skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, I would also start networking earlier as this might&#39;ve led to securing internships and/or junior positions. If people know you are searching for an opportunity then they will think of you when they have something. Or it&#39;ll at least give you an advantage in the application process as they will know who you are and that you have a genuine interest in the field.</p>\r\n', '2019-11-02 03:59:30', 7),
(22, 'What\'s the Difference Between a Framework and Library?', 'kunjshah45', 'frameworks-vs-libraries', '<p>Today I want to dive into the difference between a framework and a library. So, let&rsquo;s figure this out together by breaking it down:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Framework:</strong> By definition, &ldquo;&hellip;provides a standard way to build and deploy applications&rdquo; it is &ldquo;..abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code providing specific functionality..&rdquo; (1). Okay&hellip;so far so good, right? Breaking this definition down and the way I see it &mdash; it an environment for functional code to be written and manipulated by the user.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Library: </strong>According to Wikipedia, <strong>&ldquo;</strong>is a collection of implementations of behavior, written in terms of a language, that has a well-defined interface by which the behavior is invoked&rdquo; (2). Hmm okay let&rsquo;s see &mdash; so from what I&rsquo;m understanding a library is a set of packaged/compiled code with created with a specific functionalities that might want to be reused throughout the program.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To illustrate the differences between libraries and frameworks, let&rsquo;s look at two important open source solutions for building interactive webpages &mdash; jQuery and AngularJS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to 2006, DOM manipulation was messy and error prone. Web developers who wanted any level of interactivity were stuck using decade-old JavaScript APIs which could never have anticipated the needs of Web 2.0. To solve these issues, John Resig released jQuery, a set of beautiful, simple abstractions for examining and updating the DOM. Suddenly, tasks that once required many lines of code could now be accomplished in a single line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, jQuery had no requirements for how, when, or where it was used. It could be immediately incorporated into any webpage, without the need to modify existing code. It is effectively just a shorthand notation for executing common JavaScript patterns. This is what makes it a library, rather than a framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward another decade to 2017: web development is going through a similar transformation with the emergence of MV* frameworks such as React and AngularJS. Like jQuery, they offer huge, time-saving abstractions for DOM manipulation. But unlike jQuery, they can&rsquo;t be seamlessly incorporated into an existing project &mdash; as frameworks, they mandate how your code is structured and run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, one of the most useful abstractions in AngularJS is data binding &mdash; tying the value of some variable to what the user types:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This code automatically updates the &ldquo;Your name is&hellip;&rdquo; message as the user types, which would have previously required dozens of lines of vanilla JavaScript or several lines of jQuery. With AngularJS it&rsquo;s achieved without any logic at all &mdash; just an HTML template!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The catch is that we can&rsquo;t just add a &lt;script&gt; tag that pulls in AngularJS and start writing templates like this. The HTML needs to be part of an AngularJS component, which will parse it and generate the code we otherwise would have had to write ourselves. In truth, this minimal example requires dozens of lines of additional boilerplate before it will work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Libraries and Frameworks at DataFire</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With <a href=\"https://datafire.io\" target=\"_blank\">DataFire</a>, our mission is to make your data easily accessible, no matter where it lives or what you want to do with it. We provide open-source integrations for over 500 different services, such as Slack, GitHub, and MongoDB, as well as a command-line tool for connecting them. But is it a library or a framework?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is both. For each service we connect to, we provide a client library, available on npm. For instance, you can install the Reddit RSS library like this: npm install @datafire/reddit_rss</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then use it in JavaScript:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like jQuery, you can use this anywhere you want Reddit data. Each of the 500+ DataFire clients can be incorporated into an existing codebase without modification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But DataFire also <a href=\"https://github.com/DataFire/DataFire\" target=\"_blank\">provides a framework</a> &mdash; a set of high-level abstractions for building, connecting, and triggering actions. If you&rsquo;re looking to build an API or sync data between two services, the DataFire framework can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To use it, you need to install the DataFire command-line tool:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nnpm install -g datafire</pre>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion: Tradeoffs and Control</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a clear tradeoff when deciding whether you should be providing a library or a framework, and it all comes down to control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libraries offer the user a large amount of control, and have a low barrier to entry. They can be seamlessly incorporated into existing projects to add new functionality, and generally require little learning and boilerplate code to get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frameworks are more powerful, but mandate how users organize their code. They are more likely to be used when starting a new project rather than incorporated into an existing codebase, and the developer will need to learn about the framework&rsquo;s core concepts before they can start using it productively. But this inversion of control also helps developers avoid common errors, inefficiencies, and <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding\" target=\"_blank\">bikeshedding</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, frameworks are more opinionated and libraries are more flexible. Both patterns of abstraction have their place in the world of programming, and while neither is inherently better, it&rsquo;s important to determine which is appropriate for the problem you&rsquo;re solving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank You.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '2019-11-02 04:43:00', 18),
(23, 'Will Your Face Replace Your Passport As Biometric Tech Takes Over?', 'kunjshah', 'face-recognition-airport-digiyatra', '<p>If you took a flight from Delhi or Bengaluru recently, you may have noticed a gate at the airport with a tall display screen, along with a camera. This is the government&rsquo;s much-touted <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/digiyatra/\">DigiYatra</a> programme&mdash;a paperless travel concept being rolled out in some Indian airports. The scanner uses facial recognition technology to let people enter the terminal without having to show an ID at the gate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the government has claimed that the service, first announced in 2017, will allow for &ldquo;hassle-free&rdquo; travel, privacy activists have argued that the costs are not worth the slightly shorter queues it promises, especially considering India still doesn&rsquo;t have a data protection law. Even otherwise, there are serious concerns about the <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/facial-recognition-ncrb-police_in_5d43ccf5e4b0aca3411b6dd1\">reliability of facial recognition systems</a>, which the government wants to use even to solve crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a journey from Bengaluru to Delhi and back a little while ago, this reporter tried using the DigiYatra service to understand how it works.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How does DigiYatra work for a traveller?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The service is still in the initial stages right now. In Hyderabad, your face can get you inside the terminal, but that&rsquo;s about it. It proved impossible to try out the system at the Bengaluru airport as even on multiple visits, the DigiYatra scanners were not working. However, the government has promised that once the glitches are ironed out, you&rsquo;ll not only be able to enter the airport, but also the security areas, <em>and</em> board the plane without having to show your boarding pass anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to use DigiYatra, you need to first register yourself with the system. This reporter had earlier registered himself at a kiosk outside the Hyderabad airport, using an Aadhaar OTP to confirm his identity and link it to the photograph taken there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After you are registered, you go to the DigiYatra gate where you scan your ticket and your face to link your flight details to your identity, and then walk in through an exclusive gate that&rsquo;s reserved for DigiYatra. Right now, that&rsquo;s where your DigiYatra experience ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Registration has been halted, but during the period in which one could register at a kiosk at the airport, it was a slightly confusing process. People would line up, be told to stand and then look in different directions while the system captured the facial image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a slightly time consuming process and people at the airport are not at their most patient. Things become worse when you have to confirm an OTP &mdash;&nbsp;the process gets delayed and although people were getting registered, you could see more than a few people looking like they were starting to rethink the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Airport employees told<em> HuffPost India </em>that currently, new registrations have been paused as the service is still being trialled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after you&rsquo;ve registered at the kiosk, you still need to carry your ticket at least until the DigiYatra gate, where you scan your face and then your ticket to confirm your flight. Only then can you enter&mdash;not a noticeably faster process than the cursory glance the CISF guards take at your ID and then your face while double-checking travel details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that&rsquo;s ignoring the fact that during the trial phase, CISF guards are actually checking details right now as a safety measure. Right now, the only benefit of using DigiYatra is that since you&rsquo;ll be among a handful who do, you can breeze through the gate without waiting in line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bengaluru, a CISF guard at the gate told <em>HuffPost India</em> that terminal access through DigiYatra active, and the gate was only temporarily closed. However, he wouldn&rsquo;t confirm when it would be open, or why it was closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Hyderabad, the CISF guards were accompanied by a woman wearing a T-shirt with the airport&rsquo;s logo, who stood next to the DigiYatra scanner, and answered questions about the service. However, once this reporter identified himself, she asked not to be named as her role was to facilitate travelers, and not to speak to the media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She told us that passengers who have previously enrolled for Digiyatra were using the scanner. &ldquo;Everyday, people come and ask about this and how they can register,&rdquo; she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, she could not clarify which entity would hold the passenger data, or how you could opt out of facial recognition tracking after enrolling for DigiYatra. According to the<a href=\"http://civilaviation.gov.in/sites/default/files/Digi%20Yatra%20Policy%2009%20Aug%2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> DigiYatra policy</a> guidelines, your data is not being used for anything more than facilitating your transit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This facial data cannot be stored by airports for longer than the duration of transit of passenger and facial data will be purged out of the system 1 hour after take-off/ departure of the flight,&rdquo; it states. This includes biometric data from<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/aadhaar/\"> Aadhaar</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But personnel on the ground were not aware of this, and there&rsquo;s no clarity on whether the system is actually deleting the data as the guidelines promise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why do we need DigiYatra anyway?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>India is not the only country to try out a facial recognition systems for flights. A couple of years ago, a<a href=\"https://the-ken.com/story/biometric-future-of-travel/\" target=\"_blank\"> report</a> by <em>The Ken</em> quoted Bjorn Becker, Senior Director Product Management, Ground Ops, Lufthansa, who said one-step biometric boarding &ldquo;cut boarding time by half&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We boarded approximately 350 passengers onto an A380 in about 20 minutes in comparison to 35-40 mins earlier.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also quoted a US customs official as saying that &ldquo;a biometric entry-exit system based on facial recognition is minimally disruptive to the flow of travel&hellip; strengthening the integrity of the immigration system, making our borders stronger.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that facial recognition systems aren&rsquo;t perfect. Kritika Bhardwaj wrote in <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/facial-recognition-ncrb-police_in_5d43ccf5e4b0aca3411b6dd1\"><em>HuffPost India</em></a> earlier this month that &ldquo;facial recognition systems are less accurate in identifying ethnic minorities and women, leading to a higher possibility of misidentification&mdash;and therefore discrimination&rdquo; against communities that are already vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numerous cases of data being leaked from government servers in India should also raise a warning bell for users. This may turn out to be yet another opportunity for the government to make money at the cost of our privacy, as illustrated by examples such as the Indian Railways looking at ways to<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/07/18/the-indian-railways-is-sitting-on-a-giant-trove-of-your-travel-data-the-modi-govt-wants-to-sell-it-and-experts-are-worried-dek_a_23484279/\"> make money from the data</a> gathered from passengers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While DigiYatra is an optional system, opting out isn&rsquo;t always easy. In the US, airlines and airports have started to implement facial recognition-based boarding systems more frequently now, and people are finding out that<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/opt-out-of-facial-recognition-at-the-airport/\" target=\"_blank\"> opting out is pretty hard</a>. As this report states:</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><em>To figure out how to do so, I had to leave the boarding line, speak with a Delta representative at their information desk, get back in line, then request a passport scan when it was my turn to board.</em></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; Would you expect things to be any simpler and more user friendly in India?

(25, 'Dark Mode Looks Good, But Is It Actually Hurting You?', 'kunjshah45', 'dark-mode-looks-good-but-is-it-actually-hurting-you', '<p>Over the last few years, everyone&rsquo;s been talking about Dark Mode. It&rsquo;s said to boost productivity and focus while reducing eye strain. It&rsquo;s also supposed to be better for your battery life. But is that the whole story?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research into the matter suggests that Dark Mode might not be so healthy for us after all. Today, I want to take a look at what the data suggests and how you can use this information to determine how and when Dark Mode should be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dark Mode is everywhere: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/home\">Twitter</a> has it; <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> does, too; <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/mac/\">Mac</a> users can get it; <a href=\"http://www.android.com\">Android</a> users will get it in upcoming update;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.sketch.com/\">Sketch</a> has a Dark Mode; <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> comes with it out of the box; and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\">Chrome</a> allows its users to choose what kind of dark mode they use. Like I said, it&rsquo;s in a lot of places where we work. The question is, though, is it a good idea to use it?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Polarity Affects Legibility</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Polarity, in web design, refers to the contrast between the typography and the background it sits on. Positive polarity is when black text appears on a white background and negative polarity is when white text appears on a black background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of studies in recent years prove that positive polarity is best for legibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Study #1:</strong> In 2013, researchers set out to determine how polarity affected the act of proofreading. What they found was that positive polarity provided an easier reading experience, especially with smaller font sizes (they tested fonts between 8 and 14 pts). They attribute this enhanced legibility to the brighter luminance of the white background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Study #2:</strong> In 2014, researchers wanted to test whether or not it really was luminance that affected legibility. To determine this, they studied subjects&rsquo; pupil sizes as they read positive polarity and negative polarity texts. Those who read positive polarity text had smaller pupils. And because smaller pupils sharpen one&rsquo;s ability to perceive finer details, the study proved that positive polarity leads to a better, more accurate reading experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Study #3:</strong> In 2016, further research was done into the matter. This time, their focus was on glance-like conditions (like while driving a car or, say, glancing at a line of code you just wrote). The results of the study showed that negative polarity in a dark ambient environment made it the most difficult to read. Only the positive polarity environments (in both dark and brightly illuminated areas) were ideal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Black text on a white background provides the optimal reading experience. If for some reason you prefer the Dark Mode interface, only use it when you don&rsquo;t have much reading to do and accuracy isn&rsquo;t an absolute must.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Some Medical Professionals Don&rsquo;t Believe It Has Any Effect</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just researchers that have taken an interest in the validity of Dark Mode&rsquo;s health benefits. Medical professionals are getting in on the conversation, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ophthalmology Director of Modernizing Medicine, Dr. Michael B. Rivers, echoed that sentiment in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeharpaz/2019/07/26/will-your-iphones-dark-mode-save-your-eyes-this-and-other-ophthalmology-health-insights/#56bf80041045\">a recent Forbes article</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>While bright light in the evening is known to disrupt circadian rhythms, there&rsquo;s no real evidence that white font on a dark screen is easier to read than the reverse.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ophthalmologist Dr. Euna Koo spoke to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/tech/dark-mode-iphone-explainer/index.html\">CNN Business</a> about this subject and said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I do not think dark mode affects eye health in any way given the data that is out there in the literature. The duration of use is likely much more important than the mode or the intensity of the brightness of the device when it comes to the effect of this dark mode on eye fatigue and potentially eye health.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/dark-mode-chrome-android-ios-science\">Wired</a> rounded up the opinions of a couple professors of human-computer interaction from UCL. This is what Anna Cox had to say about the relationship between Dark Mode and productivity:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, externally driven distractions don&rsquo;t just disappear by changing their colour, and internally driven distractions aren&rsquo;t inhibited by looking at something dark.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if doctors and professors are coming forward to debunk the myth that Dark Mode helps with visibility and concentration, we should probably listen to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. It Might Be Affecting Your Mood</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This one I don&rsquo;t have as solid proof for, though I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we see more studies done on this in the coming years. Here&rsquo;s what I do know:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/down-in-the-dark/\">The deprivation of light</a> can change how our brains work and can lead to greater levels of depression. For those of you who&rsquo;ve lived in a place like Seattle before, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/northwest/sun-and-aloha-saved-me-how-seattleites-cope-as-our-fall-and-winter-days-get-darker/\">Seasonal affective disorder</a> (or SAD) is a condition that causes people to feel tired, unmotivated, and depressed&hellip;all because of a lack of exposure to light. This is especially problematic in parts of the world where the days are short and the sun only comes out a couple months of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can attest to this. It took just one year of living in Seattle before I had to see my doctor about the extreme fatigue and depression I was experiencing. She and a couple other medical professionals I talked to all said the same thing: &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s normal. We&rsquo;re all depressed here. Get a SAD lamp.&rdquo; (Basically, because there is no sunshine to naturally wake your body up or to help rejuvenate you throughout the day, your circadian rhythms get all messed up. And a SAD lamp emulates that boost of light you&rsquo;re missing throughout the day.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering what we know about blue light and its disruptive effects on melatonin and sleep, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if these same blue light-emitting screens can help us stay awake and focused during the day. If that&rsquo;s the case, Dark Mode &mdash; at least when used in excess &mdash; might actually be hurting our productivity and alertness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Wrap-Up</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As more of the tools we use to do business with offer up a Dark Mode option, should we take it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on what the research and professionals are saying, I don&rsquo;t think so. It seems like Dark Mode is more of an aesthetic choice than one you&rsquo;d make because it&rsquo;s going to improve how effective you are at work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, hey, if you prefer the sleek and subdued look of Dark Mode and find that it doesn&rsquo;t have any adverse effects on you, have at it. That said, if you&rsquo;re wondering why you can&rsquo;t stay focused or awake at your computer, a better option might be to stick with the traditional white screen and adhere to smarter work practices: take frequent breaks from the screen, get outside, and work during your most productive hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '2019-11-05 16:44:01', 33),

Here are the three ways which makes Cloud Computing a better option than any traditional web hosting:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>It as on-demand service type, which means it is sold on the demand of user particularly by the hour or a minute</li>\r\n	<li>Flexibility to users from selecting as much and as little of a service according to the requirement at any given point of time</li>\r\n	<li>Users requires only the computer system and internet connection and rest is managed by the service provider</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These are three main applications of Cloud Computing which makes it more efficient and a powerful service to rely upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cloud Computing History</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When we see the dates back in 1950s and 1960s, it was not easier for employees as it is now in current scenario. There were some large mainstreams hardware infrastructure installed which we call as &ldquo;Server Room&rdquo;. Through these large server rooms employees could only access work files, messages, or a system software for work via physical cables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now imagine, if you are working in that scenario and you have to work in a place where everything is to be done manually. You have to install software manually, import data using physical cables, and if any of the component crashes, it could be catastrophic for complete system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of &ldquo;Cloud Computing&rdquo; started emerging from 1970s when IBM introduced an operating system called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/virtual-machines\" target=\"_blank\">VM (Virtual Machines)</a>. The idea of beginning with VM allowed multiple virtual machines on a single node that reduced maintaining of such large mainframes for each user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, Cloud Computing has evolved through many phases from mainframes to virtualization in Cloud.

Team of Employees don&rsquo;t have to manage multiple versions of files they are working on.</li>\r\n	<li>No need of dedicated in-house IT support to large companies as manual updating and installation of software has been eliminated completely.</li>\r\n	<li>Fixed working place for employees has also been vanished as now employees can work remotely too with cloud-based services.</li>\r\n	<li>Large amount of cost involved in installing and maintaining applications of each device was reduced to great extent. This was much beneficial for small and mid-scale enterprises.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cloud Computing Types</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cloud Computing services are broadly divided into three categories depending on the type of resources being delivered:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic\">1. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>SaaS is a type of cloud-based software or services that delivers complete application over the internet which can be run on distant computers in the Cloud. There is no need to download or install the software on each individual device. The software is entirely managed by the service provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"marker\">For example:</span>&nbsp; software like Salesforce CRM dashboard, Quickbooks, Google Apps, Slack, Mint, etc. can be used directly on the cloud and can be customized according to user needs without any coding or programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic\">2. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>IaaS is suitable for those companies who require computing resources like servers, firewall, data center, and storage capacity. It is the most open-ended type of service which lets businesses perform a lot of customizations themselves. The best part &ndash; there is no need of large fund investments as businesses can hire IT resources and infrastructure for fast pace growth and development provided by IaaS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"marker\">For example:</span>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Amazon Web services, Rackspace, GCE, Digital Ocean, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic\">3. Platform-as-a-Service</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>PaaS lets you focus on software building, hosting, and testing at a faster and low-cost rate. It provides development tools like servers, code libraries, programming interface, etc. without taking any concerns for back-end such as security and infrastructure. PaaS allows multiple users to work on the same application simultaneously.
