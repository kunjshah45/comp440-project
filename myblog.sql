(11, 'It\'s make or break time for artificial intelligence.', 'Aashu', 'artificial-intelligence-will-make-or-break-us', '<p>Artificial Intelligence is the next technological frontier, and it has the potential to make or break the world order. The AI revolution could pull the &ldquo;bottom billion&rdquo; out of poverty and transform dysfunctional institutions, or it could entrench injustice and increase inequality. The outcome will depend on how we manage the coming changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to managing technological revolutions, humanity has a rather poor track record. Consider the Internet, which has had an enormous impact on societies worldwide, changing how we communicate, work, and occupy ourselves. And it has disrupted some economic sectors, forced changes to long-established business models, and created a few entirely new industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Internet has not brought the kind of comprehensive transformation that many anticipated. It certainly didn&rsquo;t resolve the big problems, such as eradicating poverty or <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/429690/why-we-cant-solve-big-problems/\" target=\"_blank\">enabling</a> us to reach Mars. As PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel once noted: &ldquo;We wanted flying cars; instead, we got 140 characters.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, in some ways, the Internet has exacerbated our problems. While it has created opportunities for ordinary people, it has created even more opportunities for the wealthiest and most powerful. A <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/website-archive/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2016/02/Internet--social-inequalities.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">recent study</a> by researchers at the LSE reveals that the Internet has increased inequality, with educated, high-income people deriving the greatest benefits online and multinational corporations able to grow massively &ndash; while evading accountability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps, though, the AI revolution can deliver the change we need. Already, AI &ndash; which focuses on advancing the cognitive functions of machines so that they can &ldquo;learn&rdquo; on their own &ndash; is reshaping our lives. It has delivered self-driving (though still not flying) cars, as well as virtual personal assistants and even autonomous weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this barely scratches the surface of AI&rsquo;s potential, which is likely to produce societal, economic, and political transformations that we cannot yet fully comprehend. AI will not become a new industry; it will penetrate and permanently alter every industry in existence. AI will not change human life; it will change the boundaries and meaning of being human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How and when this transformation will happen &ndash; and how to manage its far-reaching effects &ndash; are questions that keep scholars and policymakers up at night. Expectations for the AI era range from visions of paradise, in which all of humanity&rsquo;s problems have been solved, to fears of dystopia, in which our creation becomes an existential threat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making predictions about scientific breakthroughs is notoriously difficult. On September 11, 1933, the famed nuclear physicist Lord Rutherford <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602776/yes-we-are-worried-about-the-existential-risk-of-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\">told a large audience</a>, &ldquo;Anyone who looks for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms is talking moonshine.&rdquo; The next morning, Leo Szilard hypothesized the idea of a neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction; soon thereafter, he patented the nuclear reactor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem, for some, is the assumption that new technological breakthroughs are incomparable to those in the past. Many scholars, pundits, and practitioners would agree with Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt that technological phenomena have their own intrinsic properties, which humans &ldquo;don&rsquo;t understand&rdquo; and should not &ldquo;mess with.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others may be making the opposite mistake, placing too much stock in historical analogies. The technology writer and researcher <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/evgeny-morozov\" target=\"_blank\">Evgeny Morozov</a>, among others, expects some degree of path dependence, with current discourses shaping our thinking about the future of technology, thereby influencing technology&rsquo;s development. Future technologies could subsequently impact our narratives, creating a sort of self-reinforcing loop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To think about a technological breakthrough like AI, we must find a balance between these approaches. We must adopt an interdisciplinary perspective, underpinned by an agreed vocabulary and a common conceptual framework. We also need policies that address the interconnections among technology, governance, and ethics. Recent initiatives, such as <a href=\"https://www.partnershiponai.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Partnership on AI</a> or <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/press/releases/knight-foundation-omidyar-network-and-linkedin-founder-reid-hoffman-create-27-million-fund-to-research-artificial-intelligence-for-the-public-interest\" target=\"_blank\">Ethics and Governance of AI Fund</a> are a step in the right direction, but lack the necessary government involvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These steps are necessary to answer some fundamental questions: What makes humans human? Is it the pursuit of hyper-efficiency &ndash; the &ldquo;Silicon Valley&rdquo; mindset? Or is it irrationality, imperfection, and doubt &ndash; traits beyond the reach of any non-biological entity?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only by answering such questions can we determine which values we must protect and preserve in the coming AI age, as we rethink the basic concepts and terms of our social contracts, including the national and international institutions that have allowed inequality and insecurity to proliferate. In a context of far-reaching transformation, brought about by the rise of AI, we may be able to reshape the <em>status quo</em>, so that it ensures greater security and fairness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the keys to creating a more egalitarian future relates to data. Progress in AI relies on the availability and analysis of large sets of data on human activity, online and offline, to distinguish patterns of behavior that can be used to guide machine behavior and cognition. Empowering all people in the age of AI will require each individual &ndash; not major companies &ndash; to own the data they create.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the right approach, we could ensure that AI empowers people on an unprecedented scale. Though abundant historical evidence casts doubt on such an outcome, perhaps doubt is the key. As the late sociologist Zygmunt Bauman put it, &ldquo;questioning the ostensibly unquestionable premises of our way of life is arguably the most urgent of services we owe our fellow humans and ourselves.&rdquo;</p>\r\n', 'image_2.jpg', '2019-11-23 03:03:28', 3, 48),
(13, 'A Simple Solution to Poor Office Communication', 'Aashu', 'a-simple-solution-to', 'How about this: Sit everyone down and tell them to stop complaining — they should be jumping for joy that you’re all still in business! Remind them that if they were working harder they wouldn’t have time to complain. Then end everything in a team cheer (but a fast one, because people need to stop yapping and get back to work).\r\nMore seriously, you’re facing a common problem for companies of your size. Back when you ran a smaller company, there was no need for company-wide emails and meetings to keep people aligned. You all worked in the same room, and spoke daily and company direction could largely be absorbed by the employees through osmosis.\r\nBut now that approach isn’t working. You’ve brought on staff who you’re not necessarily in touch with each day, and they’re saying they don’t understand the bigger picture, or perhaps even what their colleagues in other departments are doing. Meanwhile, your earliest employees aren’t sure what has changed about the initial vision, which continues, rightly or wrongly, to guide their own decision-making.\r\nAt this point you should be doing some kind of company all-hands at least once a month (ideally more frequently than this). You don’t need a fancy PowerPoint presentation or any prepped material (that’s always nice, but let’s be realistic). The point is to get up and give an overview of where the business is, what big highlights (and challenges) you’ve faced over the past month, and where things are headed. You’ve got a roadmap, right? Pull that out and show people how you are tracking. Come back to that roadmap or overall plan again and again.\r\nThis approach is obviously helpful for keeping your team aligned, but it also has other benefits: It’s motivating for people to understand how the company is moving forward, and if you’ve hit a rough patch, it’s helpful for them to understand the roadblocks that are slowing you down.\r\nIf you can swing doing this every week or every two weeks, even better. Even if you’re just giving a five-minute overview, then taking questions, that’s still a valuable half hour of time in which you will manage to hit all your employees in one go. Bonuses: your employees will see you as human; they’ll have a chance to get answers to questions their own manager may not be able to answer; and they are reminded, as they sit and share drinks and snacks with others, that they are part of a bigger team and a grand plan.\r\nThe point is that each team should be giving a snapshot of what they are doing and how it relates to the overall business.\r\nPlay with the structure of your all-hands, and if employees are receptive, see how you can expand the content of the session now and then to help bridge the potential disconnect between different teams. Make your engineering team “own” one all-hands, where they get 10 minutes to present what they are doing. The marketing and communications folks get the following month, and your sales people the next. The content matters, but it doesn’t need to be perfect. The point is that each team should be giving a snapshot of what they are doing and how it relates to the overall business — and just as importantly, giving some guidance as to how they can help or when they should be looped in on something. This is obviously also a great way for people to learn about people outside their departments.\r\nThere are plenty of other things you can look at — for example, company-wide emails to celebrate big successes, a quarterly presentation with updates on the business, and a regular check-in with your non-technical teams to understand their blind spots and broader plans.\r\nOne final note: A retreat doesn’t count. I’ve often been struck by the number of start-ups I know that are great about taking their companies on Napa or Cabo boondoggles, but don’t have basic company-wide meetings in place. Sure, giving your employees a chance to connect at a winery or beach bar is a lot of fun (and full of potential HR infractions!) but it’s not a replacement for ensuring that employees have the information they need to do their jobs. And here’s a bonus: you’re less likely to end up with a lawsuit from a company all-hands than from that boozy winery trip!', 'image_new3.jpg', '2019-10-17 18:57:24', 1, 8),

(21, 'How to Learn to Code and Get Your First Job', 'Glyn Lewington', 'learning-to-code-your-first-job', '<p>How I Learned to Code and Got My First Job</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My coding journey began about two and a half years ago, and I started working my first full-time developer job recently (wooo!). This might seem like a long time for some of you, but I didn&#39;t rush it and wasn&#39;t trying to find work until two months ago. Many people have done it more quickly and I was probably ready for a while. So I&#39;ve decided to share my story, my resources, and what worked for me when learning web development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How I got interested in coding</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was living in Thailand, training and fighting Muay Thai while working about 10 hours a week as a social media manager. I wasn&#39;t really enjoying marketing as a career and it wasn&#39;t as flexible as I wished, since I needed to be active at certain hours of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily I had the time to learn something new. I&#39;d looked at a few things online which sounded like good skills to have that were flexible and that could be done remotely. But it wasn&#39;t until I met a guy traveling through Vietnam, who was working as a web developer, that I was intrigued and started to play around a little bit with coding.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where To Learn?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, I was jumping around trying out different sites such as Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and others I can&#39;t recall. I never really got anywhere with these to start with but they got me interested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After researching, I decided to take CS50 - Introduction To Computer Science, a famous Harvard course run by David Malan. It teaches the real basics of computer science such as data structures, algorithms, and the relevant workings of a computer. This is all done in C but the basics you learn and the confidence you build apply to every language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I completed CS50 I started on freeCodeCamp. What I loved about freeCodeCamp most was the projects. They give you great ideas to practice and test your skills as you are learning. Once I got through the first couple of sections on HTML/CSS/JavaScript and onto more advanced topics, I didn&#39;t find the lessons thorough enough. So I ditched them for Udemy courses which went more in depth on a topic. Then I could go back and build the freeCodeCamp projects for practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used this combination of Udemy and freeCodeCamp until I had a solid grasp of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, and Redux. I also completed all of the projects on freeCodeCamp except for the data visualisation section using D3.js, as I didn&#39;t find this skill in demand when looking at jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I was confident in these skills, I still hadn&#39;t gotten involved in open source except for a couple of tiny pull requests. I simply didn&#39;t know where to get started. Every time I looked at issues I couldn&#39;t see anything interesting. Or those that were interesting had already been claimed by someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, I got involved with freeCodeCamp as a contributor. I would recommend just making a habit of checking the issues once a week or so to see if there&#39;s something that you want to help with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with my work with open source, I also got an internship as a front-end developer focused on React. It wasn&#39;t the ideal internship but it was remote and I learned a lot by working on a codebase someone else had built. I was the only dev on the front-end. This presented it&#39;s own challenges, like being given a problem and being responsible for researching and solving it. In this time, I learned about and implemented internationalisation as well as React Native.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Getting the Job</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a strong mix of skills, projects and experience to show off, my r&eacute;sum&eacute; in hand, and a portfolio site promoting my work. I was ready!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting the job was mostly a game of patience. All together it took me 2 months of searching and applying every day to jobs. Most of the time I didn&#39;t hear back. I applied for a lot of jobs which were looking for mid level developers or more experience than I had, which didn&#39;t work out. Most of the jobs I found on job boards were advertised by recruiters and I found these the most fruitful. I often received a call and meeting with recruiters who were impressed by my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and skills and were looking for junior roles for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was also attending meetups to network and look for jobs. I didn&#39;t find any roles directly, as the companies weren&#39;t looking for juniors. However, I did meet a recruiter at a React meetup whom I grabbed coffee with the next week. He had a role from a company that was open to juniors and this is where I ended up accepting a position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hiring process for this position consisted of a tech test (https://github.com/GlynL/tech-test-prendi), and then an interview where I was actually offered the job at the end. It&#39;s a great small company where I&#39;m working with the senior developer and can bounce ideas and get help when I need it. It&#39;s a full-stack job, I get to use React daily, and I will get the chance to work with a lot of technologies as projects require them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was interviewing, the thing that people appreciated most was that I had worked on a real application in an internship. Even if I could have done everything in a personal project it proved that I could work on a real world application with other people. I would certainly recommend seeking out internships as this will look great on your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and will be a talking point during interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What would I do differently?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If I were to do it all over again, there&#39;s a couple of things I would do differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, I would get more involved with open source projects much earlier on. There&#39;s always something you can contribute to a project even if you are still learning HTML and CSS. You may have to be more particular about the issues you pick up but you can definitely help! The skills you gain in navigating a large codebase and working with others are invaluable. And as you learn more you can pick more complex issues to match your skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, I would also start networking earlier as this might&#39;ve led to securing internships and/or junior positions. If people know you are searching for an opportunity then they will think of you when they have something.

So, let&rsquo;s figure this out together by breaking it down:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Framework:</strong> By definition, &ldquo;&hellip;provides a standard way to build and deploy applications&rdquo; it is &ldquo;..abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code providing specific functionality..&rdquo; (1). Okay&hellip;so far so good, right? Breaking this definition down and the way I see it &mdash; it an environment for functional code to be written and manipulated by the user.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Library: </strong>According to Wikipedia, <strong>&ldquo;</strong>is a collection of implementations of behavior, written in terms of a language, that has a well-defined interface by which the behavior is invoked&rdquo; (2). Hmm okay let&rsquo;s see &mdash; so from what I&rsquo;m understanding a library is a set of packaged/compiled code with created with a specific functionalities that might want to be reused throughout the program.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To illustrate the differences between libraries and frameworks, let&rsquo;s look at two important open source solutions for building interactive webpages &mdash; jQuery and AngularJS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to 2006, DOM manipulation was messy and error prone. Web developers who wanted any level of interactivity were stuck using decade-old JavaScript APIs which could never have anticipated the needs of Web 2.0. To solve these issues, John Resig released jQuery, a set of beautiful, simple abstractions for examining and updating the DOM. Suddenly, tasks that once required many lines of code could now be accomplished in a single line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, jQuery had no requirements for how, when, or where it was used. It could be immediately incorporated into any webpage, without the need to modify existing code. It is effectively just a shorthand notation for executing common JavaScript patterns. This is what makes it a library, rather than a framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward another decade to 2017: web development is going through a similar transformation with the emergence of MV* frameworks such as React and AngularJS. Like jQuery, they offer huge, time-saving abstractions for DOM manipulation. But unlike jQuery, they can&rsquo;t be seamlessly incorporated into an existing project &mdash; as frameworks, they mandate how your code is structured and run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, one of the most useful abstractions in AngularJS is data binding &mdash; tying the value of some variable to what the user types:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This code automatically updates the &ldquo;Your name is&hellip;&rdquo; message as the user types, which would have previously required dozens of lines of vanilla JavaScript or several lines of jQuery. With AngularJS it&rsquo;s achieved without any logic at all &mdash; just an HTML template!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The catch is that we can&rsquo;t just add a &lt;script&gt; tag that pulls in AngularJS and start writing templates like this. The HTML needs to be part of an AngularJS component, which will parse it and generate the code we otherwise would have had to write ourselves. In truth, this minimal example requires dozens of lines of additional boilerplate before it will work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Libraries and Frameworks at DataFire</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With <a href=\"https://datafire.io\" target=\"_blank\">DataFire</a>, our mission is to make your data easily accessible, no matter where it lives or what you want to do with it. We provide open-source integrations for over 500 different services, such as Slack, GitHub, and MongoDB, as well as a command-line tool for connecting them. But is it a library or a framework?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is both. For each service we connect to, we provide a client library, available on npm. For instance, you can install the Reddit RSS library like this: npm install @datafire/reddit_rss</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then use it in JavaScript:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like jQuery, you can use this anywhere you want Reddit data. Each of the 500+ DataFire clients can be incorporated into an existing codebase without modification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But DataFire also <a href=\"https://github.com/DataFire/DataFire\" target=\"_blank\">provides a framework</a> &mdash; a set of high-level abstractions for building, connecting, and triggering actions. If you&rsquo;re looking to build an API or sync data between two services, the DataFire framework can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To use it, you need to install the DataFire command-line tool:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nnpm install -g datafire</pre>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion: Tradeoffs and Control</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a clear tradeoff when deciding whether you should be providing a library or a framework, and it all comes down to control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libraries offer the user a large amount of control, and have a low barrier to entry. They can be seamlessly incorporated into existing projects to add new functionality, and generally require little learning and boilerplate code to get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frameworks are more powerful, but mandate how users organize their code. They are more likely to be used when starting a new project rather than incorporated into an existing codebase, and the developer will need to learn about the framework&rsquo;s core concepts before they can start using it productively. But this inversion of control also helps developers avoid common errors, inefficiencies, and <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding\" target=\"_blank\">bikeshedding</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, frameworks are more opinionated and libraries are more flexible. Both patterns of abstraction have their place in the world of programming, and while neither is inherently better, it&rsquo;s important to determine which is appropriate for the problem you&rsquo;re solving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank You.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'framework.jpg', '2019-11-02 04:43:00', 1, 18),

This is the government&rsquo;s much-touted <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/digiyatra/\">DigiYatra</a> programme&mdash;a paperless travel concept being rolled out in some Indian airports. The scanner uses facial recognition technology to let people enter the terminal without having to show an ID at the gate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the government has claimed that the service, first announced in 2017, will allow for &ldquo;hassle-free&rdquo; travel, privacy activists have argued that the costs are not worth the slightly shorter queues it promises, especially considering India still doesn&rsquo;t have a data protection law. Even otherwise, there are serious concerns about the <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/facial-recognition-ncrb-police_in_5d43ccf5e4b0aca3411b6dd1\">reliability of facial recognition systems</a>, which the government wants to use even to solve crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a journey from Bengaluru to Delhi and back a little while ago, this reporter tried using the DigiYatra service to understand how it works.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How does DigiYatra work for a traveller?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The service is still in the initial stages right now. In Hyderabad, your face can get you inside the terminal, but that&rsquo;s about it. It proved impossible to try out the system at the Bengaluru airport as even on multiple visits, the DigiYatra scanners were not working. However, the government has promised that once the glitches are ironed out, you&rsquo;ll not only be able to enter the airport, but also the security areas, <em>and</em> board the plane without having to show your boarding pass anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to use DigiYatra, you need to first register yourself with the system. This reporter had earlier registered himself at a kiosk outside the Hyderabad airport, using an Aadhaar OTP to confirm his identity and link it to the photograph taken there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After you are registered, you go to the DigiYatra gate where you scan your ticket and your face to link your flight details to your identity, and then walk in through an exclusive gate that&rsquo;s reserved for DigiYatra. Right now, that&rsquo;s where your DigiYatra experience ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Registration has been halted, but during the period in which one could register at a kiosk at the airport, it was a slightly confusing process. People would line up, be told to stand and then look in different directions while the system captured the facial image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a slightly time consuming process and people at the airport are not at their most patient. Things become worse when you have to confirm an OTP &mdash;&nbsp;the process gets delayed and although people were getting registered, you could see more than a few people looking like they were starting to rethink the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Airport employees told<em> HuffPost India </em>that currently, new registrations have been paused as the service is still being trialled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after you&rsquo;ve registered at the kiosk, you still need to carry your ticket at least until the DigiYatra gate, where you scan your face and then your ticket to confirm your flight. Only then can you enter&mdash;not a noticeably faster process than the cursory glance the CISF guards take at your ID and then your face while double-checking travel details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that&rsquo;s ignoring the fact that during the trial phase, CISF guards are actually checking details right now as a safety measure. Right now, the only benefit of using DigiYatra is that since you&rsquo;ll be among a handful who do, you can breeze through the gate without waiting in line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bengaluru, a CISF guard at the gate told <em>HuffPost India</em> that terminal access through DigiYatra active, and the gate was only temporarily closed. However, he wouldn&rsquo;t confirm when it would be open, or why it was closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Hyderabad, the CISF guards were accompanied by a woman wearing a T-shirt with the airport&rsquo;s logo, who stood next to the DigiYatra scanner, and answered questions about the service. However, once this reporter identified himself, she asked not to be named as her role was to facilitate travelers, and not to speak to the media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She told us that passengers who have previously enrolled for Digiyatra were using the scanner. &ldquo;Everyday, people come and ask about this and how they can register,&rdquo; she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, she could not clarify which entity would hold the passenger data, or how you could opt out of facial recognition tracking after enrolling for DigiYatra. According to the<a href=\"http://civilaviation.gov.in/sites/default/files/Digi%20Yatra%20Policy%2009%20Aug%2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> DigiYatra policy</a> guidelines, your data is not being used for anything more than facilitating your transit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This facial data cannot be stored by airports for longer than the duration of transit of passenger and facial data will be purged out of the system 1 hour after take-off/ departure of the flight,&rdquo; it states. This includes biometric data from<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/aadhaar/\"> Aadhaar</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But personnel on the ground were not aware of this, and there&rsquo;s no clarity on whether the system is actually deleting the data as the guidelines promise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why do we need DigiYatra anyway?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>India is not the only country to try out a facial recognition systems for flights. A couple of years ago, a<a href=\"https://the-ken.com/story/biometric-future-of-travel/\" target=\"_blank\"> report</a> by <em>The Ken</em> quoted Bjorn Becker, Senior Director Product Management, Ground Ops, Lufthansa, who said one-step biometric boarding &ldquo;cut boarding time by half&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We boarded approximately 350 passengers onto an A380 in about 20 minutes in comparison to 35-40 mins earlier.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also quoted a US customs official as saying that &ldquo;a biometric entry-exit system based on facial recognition is minimally disruptive to the flow of travel&hellip; strengthening the integrity of the immigration system, making our borders stronger.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that facial recognition systems aren&rsquo;t perfect. Kritika Bhardwaj wrote in <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/facial-recognition-ncrb-police_in_5d43ccf5e4b0aca3411b6dd1\"><em>HuffPost India</em></a> earlier this month that &ldquo;facial recognition systems are less accurate in identifying ethnic minorities and women, leading to a higher possibility of misidentification&mdash;and therefore discrimination&rdquo; against communities that are already vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numerous cases of data being leaked from government servers in India should also raise a warning bell for users. This may turn out to be yet another opportunity for the government to make money at the cost of our privacy, as illustrated by examples such as the Indian Railways looking at ways to<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/07/18/the-indian-railways-is-sitting-on-a-giant-trove-of-your-travel-data-the-modi-govt-wants-to-sell-it-and-experts-are-worried-dek_a_23484279/\"> make money from the data</a> gathered from passengers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While DigiYatra is an optional system, opting out isn&rsquo;t always easy. In the US, airlines and airports have started to implement facial recognition-based boarding systems more frequently now, and people are finding out that<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/opt-out-of-facial-recognition-at-the-airport/\" target=\"_blank\"> opting out is pretty hard</a>. As this report states:</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><em>To figure out how to do so, I had to leave the boarding line, speak with a Delta representative at their information desk, get back in line, then request a passport scan when it was my turn to board.</em></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; Would you expect things to be any simpler and more user friendly in India?

(24, 'Data architecture vs backend architecture', 'Erik Bernhardsson', 'data-architecture-vs-backend-architecture', '<p>A modern tech stack typically involves at least a frontend and backend but relatively quickly also grows to include a data platform. This typically grows out of the need for ad-hoc analysis and reporting but possibly evolves into a whole oil refinery of cronjobs, dashboards, bulk data copying, and much more. What generally pushes things into the data platform is (generally) that a number of things are</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Not latency critical so can run much later, maybe up to 24h (as opposed to reactive synchronous jobs sitting on a request-response cycle)</li>\r\n	<li>Easier to express as batch job operating on a large dataset rather than operating on each request</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Reporting is a decent example. Let&rsquo;s say you need to import all transactions into your accounting system. Rather than doing it directly from the backend, it might be a lot easier to just write a script to do it every 24h.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Training machine learning models is another example. Let&rsquo;s say you are building a fraud detection system and you have a machine learning model to detect if some user action is fradulent. Training the model might take an hour but predictions are quick. It&rsquo;s much easier to re-train the model say every 24h or even every week or month. You can then serialize the model and use that for predictions in your backend system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Spotify the data platform started with royalty reporting, but quickly rebuilt the toplists to be a nightly data job. The data platform kept growing, in particular the music recommendation system, which became a humongous data pipeline. We retrained the core models every few weeks but typically regenerated personalized recommendations every night. That was frequent enough that people wouldn&rsquo;t run out of recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why bother?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Why bother with a data platform? Because things typically get 10x easier to build and ship. Pushing work out of the backend into a separate data platform helps with a few things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about latency.</li>\r\n	<li>You can control the flow yourself (rather than being at the mercy of a user request waiting for a response)</li>\r\n	<li>You can generally write things in a much more fault tolerant way (batch processing is often easier to write as a set of idempotent operations)</li>\r\n	<li>Batch processing can be a lot more efficient (generating music recommendations for 1,000,000 users is maybe only 1,000 times more work than generating for 1 user)</li>\r\n	<li>If things fail, it&rsquo;s not the end of the world, since you often fix the bug within the next day or so and just re-run the job</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, consider the basic feature of building a global toplist that updates itself in real time, say showing the top news articles on a news website. I&rsquo;m willing to bet a substantial amount of money that it&rsquo;s orders of magnitude harder to do this purely in the backend compared to building a cron job in the data platform that updates it every hour or every day and pushes the result back into the backend.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>So you do you do it (in the least hacky way)?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, backend architecture is a bit more mature, and there&rsquo;s about 1,000 blog posts about best practices. <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/\">Martin Fowler</a> is one that comes to mind for instance. When we&rsquo;re building backend systems, we&rsquo;ve been taught things like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Avoid integration databases (each system should have its own database, and two systems can never touch the same database)</li>\r\n	<li>Database queries should be simple (typically refer to an exact key and joining as few tables as possible, ideally zero)</li>\r\n	<li>Use transactions (and constraints/keys/etc) for data integrity</li>\r\n	<li>Lots of unit tests</li>\r\n	<li>Lots of integration tests</li>\r\n	<li>Decompose larger services (aka &ldquo;monoliths&rdquo;) into smaller ones (aka &ldquo;microservices&rdquo;)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The data side: the wild west</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What I&rsquo;ve seen in terms of infrastructure is typically one of these things as a starting point:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Backend logs are shipped to some data store</li>\r\n	<li>Backend production databases are dumped to some data store</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the days, this data store was typically Hadoop (HDFS) although these days it&rsquo;s often some scalable database such as Redshift. There&rsquo;s lots of different solutions and I&rsquo;m not here to opine on any of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Notes on data latency</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Anything in the data platform is typically delayed (at Spotify typically up to 24h or even more). If it&rsquo;s not delayed, then it should be considered delayed, meaning anything operating on the data should not be latency critical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can you have a data platform that operates on real-time database data rather than a delayed database dump? Yes, in theory. But I think it can encourage really bad practices. For instance if you have cron jobs operating on the production database, then it&rsquo;s easy to do things like <em>writing data back to the database</em> which now creates an integration database with multiple writers and consumers of the same table. This can be a mess! For this reason, the right separation should be that (a) cron jobs operate on delayed data (b) any communication back to the backend system happens through internal endpoints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And another word of caution: <em>don&rsquo;t give business people access to real-time data!</em> They will start to demand it for everything and you will have to support it forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, what happens on the data side? In my experience, and in my opinion, <em>anything goes.</em> Let&rsquo;s talk about some of those things:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Integration databases</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, the traditional constraint that services should not touch each other&rsquo;s databases and that those layers should be respected. This avoids the so called &ldquo;integration database&rdquo; antipattern where you have multiple writers and readers of the same data. In the data world, that rule goes out the window. On the data side, I find it completely kosher to join across 3 different dataset from different services. Why is this acceptable? I think it boils down to two things</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Schema changes that break any downstream consumers are not the end of the world. You are going to have to update some queries, that&rsquo;s it.</li>\r\n	<li>If things break, then you can typically fix it and re-run the job. If some report isn&rsquo;t generated at midnight UTC, you can fix the job in the next few hours and few will complain.</li>\r\n	<li>All queries are read-only. That means you never have to worry about transaction integrity, or reading inconsistent data.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>My conclusions is that integration databases are terrible for backend systems but great and fun in the data layer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Mega queries</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A backend system will have to deal with low-latency low-throughput queries, that usually touch only one user at a time. But that user is making a request and waiting for a response, so queries need to be <em>fast</em>. So how do you make queries fast?</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Avoid as many joins as possible. When needed, stick to very simple, indexed joins (typically left join from table A to B)</li>\r\n	<li>Every query should refer do a particular item id, eg. <code>... where user_id =<tt> 1 2 3 4</tt></code> or similar.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>I get incredibly suspicious any time I see any queries in a backend system that are more complex than a couple of tables and one or two <code>where</code> conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the data world, those things don&rsquo;t matter at all. Almost all queries are going to cut &ldquo;across&rdquo; all/most of the data, and in fact most queries will boil down to &ldquo;full table scans&rdquo;. Queries spanning pages looking like they were written by a early 20th century German philosopher? Bring it on!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is basically the difference between OLTP and OLAP which are different types of query pattern. There&rsquo;s probably lots of literature if you&rsquo;re willing to go deep!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Testing</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m writing this somewhat apologetically, maybe with a sense of guilt as I&rsquo;m admitting some dark secret. I&rsquo;m a big proponent of very thorough testing, but getting any reasonable amount of test coverage on the data side is&hellip; hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a backend system, you&rsquo;re sort of implementing functions like y=f(x) where x is an input (say a response from a 3rd party API) and y is the result (say, the API response transformed to an internal representation). That&rsquo;s really easy to test! Sometimes you have functions like Sn+1=f(Sn,A) where Si is the &ldquo;state&rdquo; and A is some action. But the state and the action is super tiny and can be reasonably well represented inside a unit test. On the data side, the x and Si are <em>huge</em>. This means any unit test basically ends up being 99% just setting up all the input data. But because the input data is super high dimensional, it also means modeling edge cases becomes exponentially harder. The just to throw a wrench into this, data pipelines can often be nondeterministic (machine learning models) or have very subjective outputs to the point where you can&rsquo;t just write up a bunch of assertions easily. For all these reasons, I&rsquo;ve found that tests for data pipelines have pretty low fidelity (they catch few bugs) and have high maintenance costs. Sad! I like to have a few basic tests to make sure things <em>run</em>, but verifying correctness might not always be worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve found it useful to push <em>as much as you can</em> out of the backend into the data platform. This includes lots of things like</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Sending (non-transactional) emails to users (like personalized marketing emails)</li>\r\n	<li>Generating search indexes</li>\r\n	<li>Generating recommendations</li>\r\n	<li>Reporting</li>\r\n	<li>Generating data for business people</li>\r\n	<li>Training machine learning models</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All of those things <em>could</em> be built into the backend system, but should probably be run as cronjobs in a data platform instead. This will reduce the complexity of your code by (roughly) an order of magnitude.</p>\r\n', 'Cloud-Computing-Architecture.jpg', '2019-11-05 16:26:58', 1, 32);

But is that the whole story?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research into the matter suggests that Dark Mode might not be so healthy for us after all. Today, I want to take a look at what the data suggests and how you can use this information to determine how and when Dark Mode should be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dark Mode is everywhere: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/home\">Twitter</a> has it; <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> does, too; <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/mac/\">Mac</a> users can get it; <a href=\"http://www.android.com\">Android</a> users will get it in upcoming update;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.sketch.com/\">Sketch</a> has a Dark Mode; <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> comes with it out of the box; and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\">Chrome</a> allows its users to choose what kind of dark mode they use. Like I said, it&rsquo;s in a lot of places where we work. The question is, though, is it a good idea to use it?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Polarity Affects Legibility</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Polarity, in web design, refers to the contrast between the typography and the background it sits on. Positive polarity is when black text appears on a white background and negative polarity is when white text appears on a black background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of studies in recent years prove that positive polarity is best for legibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Study #1:</strong> In 2013, researchers set out to determine how polarity affected the act of proofreading. What they found was that positive polarity provided an easier reading experience, especially with smaller font sizes (they tested fonts between 8 and 14 pts). They attribute this enhanced legibility to the brighter luminance of the white background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Study #2:</strong> In 2014, researchers wanted to test whether or not it really was luminance that affected legibility. To determine this, they studied subjects&rsquo; pupil sizes as they read positive polarity and negative polarity texts. Those who read positive polarity text had smaller pupils. And because smaller pupils sharpen one&rsquo;s ability to perceive finer details, the study proved that positive polarity leads to a better, more accurate reading experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Study #3:</strong> In 2016, further research was done into the matter. This time, their focus was on glance-like conditions (like while driving a car or, say, glancing at a line of code you just wrote). The results of the study showed that negative polarity in a dark ambient environment made it the most difficult to read. Only the positive polarity environments (in both dark and brightly illuminated areas) were ideal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Black text on a white background provides the optimal reading experience. If for some reason you prefer the Dark Mode interface, only use it when you don&rsquo;t have much reading to do and accuracy isn&rsquo;t an absolute must.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Some Medical Professionals Don&rsquo;t Believe It Has Any Effect</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just researchers that have taken an interest in the validity of Dark Mode&rsquo;s health benefits. Medical professionals are getting in on the conversation, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ophthalmology Director of Modernizing Medicine, Dr. Michael B. Rivers, echoed that sentiment in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeharpaz/2019/07/26/will-your-iphones-dark-mode-save-your-eyes-this-and-other-ophthalmology-health-insights/#56bf80041045\">a recent Forbes article</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>While bright light in the evening is known to disrupt circadian rhythms, there&rsquo;s no real evidence that white font on a dark screen is easier to read than the reverse.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ophthalmologist Dr. Euna Koo spoke to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/tech/dark-mode-iphone-explainer/index.html\">CNN Business</a> about this subject and said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I do not think dark mode affects eye health in any way given the data that is out there in the literature. The duration of use is likely much more important than the mode or the intensity of the brightness of the device when it comes to the effect of this dark mode on eye fatigue and potentially eye health.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/dark-mode-chrome-android-ios-science\">Wired</a> rounded up the opinions of a couple professors of human-computer interaction from UCL. This is what Anna Cox had to say about the relationship between Dark Mode and productivity:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, externally driven distractions don&rsquo;t just disappear by changing their colour, and internally driven distractions aren&rsquo;t inhibited by looking at something dark.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if doctors and professors are coming forward to debunk the myth that Dark Mode helps with visibility and concentration, we should probably listen to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. It Might Be Affecting Your Mood</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This one I don&rsquo;t have as solid proof for, though I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we see more studies done on this in the coming years. Here&rsquo;s what I do know:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/down-in-the-dark/\">The deprivation of light</a> can change how our brains work and can lead to greater levels of depression. For those of you who&rsquo;ve lived in a place like Seattle before, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/northwest/sun-and-aloha-saved-me-how-seattleites-cope-as-our-fall-and-winter-days-get-darker/\">Seasonal affective disorder</a> (or SAD) is a condition that causes people to feel tired, unmotivated, and depressed&hellip;all because of a lack of exposure to light. This is especially problematic in parts of the world where the days are short and the sun only comes out a couple months of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can attest to this. It took just one year of living in Seattle before I had to see my doctor about the extreme fatigue and depression I was experiencing. She and a couple other medical professionals I talked to all said the same thing: &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s normal. We&rsquo;re all depressed here. Get a SAD lamp.&rdquo; (Basically, because there is no sunshine to naturally wake your body up or to help rejuvenate you throughout the day, your circadian rhythms get all messed up. And a SAD lamp emulates that boost of light you&rsquo;re missing throughout the day.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering what we know about blue light and its disruptive effects on melatonin and sleep, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if these same blue light-emitting screens can help us stay awake and focused during the day. If that&rsquo;s the case, Dark Mode &mdash; at least when used in excess &mdash; might actually be hurting our productivity and alertness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Wrap-Up</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As more of the tools we use to do business with offer up a Dark Mode option, should we take it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on what the research and professionals are saying, I don&rsquo;t think so. It seems like Dark Mode is more of an aesthetic choice than one you&rsquo;d make because it&rsquo;s going to improve how effective you are at work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, hey, if you prefer the sleek and subdued look of Dark Mode and find that it doesn&rsquo;t have any adverse effects on you, have at it. That said, if you&rsquo;re wondering why you can&rsquo;t stay focused or awake at your computer, a better option might be to stick with the traditional white screen and adhere to smarter work practices: take frequent breaks from the screen, get outside, and work during your most productive hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'dark-mode.jpg', '2019-11-05 16:44:01', 4, 33),
(26, '12 JavaScript libraries to use in 2020 (alternative of ReactJS and JQuery).', 'Jake Rocheleau ', '12-javascript-libraries-to-watch-in-2020', '<p>With hundreds of free JS libraries out there it&rsquo;s tough to know where to put your energy. Some end up discarded or forked into new projects, while others grow rapidly and achieve widespread adoption. Most developers already know the big names like jQuery and React. But in this post I&rsquo;d like to introduce twelve alternative JS libraries that are less well-known but rising rapidly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1) <a href=\"http://www.d3js.org\">D3.js</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Big data is a growing industry and data visualization is quickly becoming just as important. There are tons of charting &amp; mapping libraries but few stand out as much as <a href=\"https://d3js.org/\">D3.js</a>. This JS library works with SVG and canvas elements to render graphs, charts, and dynamic visualizations on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s completely free to use, and it&rsquo;s one of the most powerful visualization tools built on JavaScript. If you&rsquo;re looking for a modern way to render data in the browser I would highly recommend taking a peek at this library to see what it offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2) <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I know many devs are sick of hearing about <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node</a> all the time. But it really is the fastest growing JS library and it offers so much more than a dev environment. With NPM you can manage local packages for all your projects right from the command line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This makes Node a full development toolkit that works well with other tools like Gulp. Plus dozens of related open source projects have been built on Node so you can work with unit testing in <a href=\"https://mochajs.org/\">Mocha.js</a> or build a front end interface with the <a href=\"http://sailsjs.org/\">Sails.js</a> framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried Node yet then you might be surprised just how much you&rsquo;re missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3) <a href=\"http://riotjs.com/\">Riot.js</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual DOM rendering and custom elements litter the React library. It has quickly become the choice of all professionals who want a powerful digital interface library for front end development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But <a href=\"http://riotjs.com/\">Riot.js</a> is putting up a solid fight offering a nice alternative to React. By using the Riot framework you still have access to a virtual DOM but it&rsquo;s much easier to control with simpler syntax requirements. Unfortunately this library isn&rsquo;t as big as React and it&rsquo;s not powered by Facebook, so you won&rsquo;t have the huge community. But it&rsquo;s a healthy alternative and it&rsquo;s a decent competitor in the front end space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4) <a href=\"http://www.createjs.com/\">Create.js</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From web animation to digital media you can work with everything in <a href=\"http://www.createjs.com/\">CreateJS</a>. This isn&rsquo;t one single library, but rather a suite of libraries built for different purposes. For example Easel.js works with HTML5 canvas elements while Tweet.js helps you build custom tweening &amp; animations for the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every library in this collection serves a different purpose and offers modern features for all major browsers. But most of these libraries help with specialized features so they&rsquo;re best used on specialty websites. If you&rsquo;re curious, then take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.createjs.com/\">Create JS website</a> to see what it offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5) <a href=\"http://keystonejs.com/\">Keystone.js</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier I mentioned Node.js and how many other libraries are built on top of it. <a href=\"http://keystonejs.com/\">Keystone.js</a> is a fantastic example that goes beyond Node by offering a full-scale CMS engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Keystone you can build <a href=\"http://www.programmableweb.com/news/what-mean-stack-and-why-it-better-lamp/analysis/2015/12/22\">MEAN webapps</a> powered by Node/Express and MongoDB on the backend. Keystone.js is completely free but still very new. At the time of this writing it&rsquo;s only in v0.3 so it has a long way to go for professional use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you&rsquo;re tickled by a pure JavaScript CMS then check it out and see what you think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6) <a href=\"http://vuejs.org/\">Vue.js</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the world of front end frameworks you typically find two prominent choices: Angular and Ember. But <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue.js</a> is another very popular choice and it&rsquo;s quickly gaining more attention since its <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-2-0-is-here-ef1f26acf4b8\">v2.0 release</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vue is an MVVM frontend JavaScript framework so it moves away from the typical MVC architecture. It&rsquo;s tricky to learn but the syntax is simple once you understand how it all works. It&rsquo;s certainly a viable choice in the war of front end frameworks, and it&rsquo;s worth keeping a close eye on it over the next few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7) <a href=\"http://www.meteor.com/\">Meteor</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can integrate any platform into the <a href=\"https://www.meteor.com/\">Meteor framework</a> with fantastic results. This open source project helps developers build JS-powered applications whether they&rsquo;re real-time chat apps or social communities or custom dashboards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s even a social news framework called <a href=\"http://www.telescopeapp.org/\">Telescope</a> built on top of Meteor. This lets you create a social news/social voting website from scratch running on Meteor and React.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meteor is a beast of a library with lots of features, but it&rsquo;s not easy to learn. However it is fun and skilled JS developers can build almost anything with this platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8) <a href=\"http://www.chartjs.org/\">Chart.js</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With <a href=\"http://www.chartjs.org/\">Chart.js</a> you can build bar charts, line charts, bubble charts, and many other similar features using JavaScript and the canvas API. This is one of the simplest JS libraries for data charting and it comes with built-in options for animations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one of the few libraries I recommend for data graphs because it&rsquo;s easy to setup, easy to customize, and it comes with some of the best <a href=\"http://www.chartjs.org/docs/\">documentation</a> of any open source project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9) <a href=\"http://webvr.info/\">WebVR</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems like virtual reality has taken the world by storm with new startups and excited developers working tirelessly on VR projects. That&rsquo;s why I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to find <a href=\"https://webvr.info/\">WebVR</a>, a new JavaScript API made for VR in your browser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This works off the most popular devices like the Oculus Rift and the Vive but it&rsquo;s currently in a development stage. The API is open source and constantly being tested against modern browsers to gauge how it functions on VR devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re curious to learn more or get involved with the project check out the <a href=\"https://webvr.info/\">official site</a> or visit the <a href=\"https://mozvr.com/\">MozVR page</a> for more info.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10) <a href=\"http://threejs.org/\">Three.js</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s crazy to see how much 3D animation has grown dating back to the 1980s up to today. We&rsquo;re all familiar with 3D animated movies but web animation is still a new frontier. And thankfully we have libraries like <a href=\"https://threejs.org/\">Three.js</a> blazing a path for 3D animation on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the main site you&rsquo;ll find dozens of live examples of Three.js in action. You can build motion-sensitive backgrounds, custom 3D web graphics, and dynamic interface elements that use 3D animation effects. If you have enough patience and drive you can build any 3D effect with this library. It is the best resource for 3D motion on the web, and it comes with <a href=\"https://threejs.org/examples/\">lots of examples</a> to get you started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>11) <a href=\"http://omniscientjs.github.io/\">Omniscient.js</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Functional programming with JavaScript is not a new thing. But it is fairly new on the web and it&rsquo;s now much more commonplace with libraries like <a href=\"http://omniscientjs.github.io/\">Omniscient.js</a>. This free open source library handles views with a top-down rendering process for all front end components. You can write functional JS code from scratch and work with existing UI libraries like React.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would specifically recommend this library to any experienced developers who want a smoother development process. It&rsquo;s a complicated subject for beginners but Omniscient can radically change your dev workflow when used in coordination with React components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>12) <a href=\"http://www.ractivejs.org/\">Ractive.js</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a UI library that&rsquo;s different than the rest I think <a href=\"http://www.ractivejs.org/\">Ractive.js</a> fits the mold well. It comes with two-way binding for template elements and data so you can construct templates with elements that bind to Ractive functions in JavaScript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a pretty dense library but it offers one of the smoothest learning curves for beginners. It&rsquo;s not as detailed as React, and it uses vastly different syntax in JS and HTML. Visit the <a href=\"http://www.ractivejs.org/\">main site</a> to learn more, and check out the <a href=\"http://examples.ractivejs.org/\">examples page</a> to see what&rsquo;s possible with Ractive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><big>All the libraries in this post have something unique to offer the JS community. If you enjoy tinkering with JavaScript then take another look over each library here and see what they can offer your web dev projects.</big></p>\r\n', 'javascript.jpg', '2019-11-05 17:04:20', 3, 34),
(27, 'Top 7 Photo Editors Like Photoshop in 2019', 'Anonymous', 'photo-editors-like-photoshop', '<p>Looking for free photo editors like Photoshop to make photos and designs more professional? Adobe Photoshop is the dream of any designer and retoucher since it offers a professional toolset for creative process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the biggest difficulty everyone faces is its quite high monthly price, which often becomes a deal-breaker and leads to many people searching for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop.html\" target=\"_blank\">Photoshop</a>&nbsp;torrents to avoid paying such a huge sum for Adobe products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, it&rsquo;s possible to find a photo editor like Photoshop that is either completely free or cheaper and is capable of doing almost everything that Photoshop can, and sometimes even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7 Photo Editors Like Photoshop</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though Adobe Photoshop is often viewed as the best option among graphics editors, its capabilities are frequently superfluous. Other than that, Adobe is transferring more and more users to the &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; system, which isn&rsquo;t to everyone&rsquo;s taste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, during the last few years, people have been complaining more and more about performance drops when using Adobe software due to the heavy load it puts on the processor. It&rsquo;s often enough to open a couple of projects in Photoshop even on a powerful PC and you won&rsquo;t even be able to use your browser comfortably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, Photoshop remains the leading choice among professionals, but more and more users are searching for decent&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fixthephoto.com/best-free-photo-editor.html\" target=\"_blank\">free photo editors</a>&nbsp;like Photoshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we have compiled list of some best photoshop alternatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Affinity Photo</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Affinity Photo started to create a stir in the creative community almost from the moment it was released. It&rsquo;s probably the most credible photo editor similar to Photoshop that we&rsquo;ve seen to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program supports Photoshop&rsquo;s signature file standards and is aimed at photographers and designers while costing significantly less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being completely compatible with Photoshop and other file formats, it targets specifically professional photographers and designers. While Affinity Photo is much cheaper than Photoshop (without a subscription), its creators state that their software is actually better, promising superior performance and fewer errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frankly speaking, the performance boost you receive will probably highly depend on what hardware you&rsquo;re using (the program was developed for using the latest quadcore technology).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pros:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Works with RAW and PSD files</li>\r\n	<li>RGB, CMYK, LAB and Greyscale support</li>\r\n	<li>Layer-focused image editing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cons:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Doesn&rsquo;t have premade lens-specific corrections</li>\r\n	<li>Users can&rsquo;t customize the workspace</li>\r\n	<li>Not very beginner-friendly</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. GIMP</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to get a free photoshop alternative that is just as powerful and multifunctional, then GIMP is one of the best alternatives. It is free, open-source, which allows a huge number of volunteers to continuously improve it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to that fact, GIMP has loads of plugins and scripts written for it and it can also work with plugins for Adobe Photoshop. Another benefit of GIMP is that it appeared all the way back in the mid-90s so you can find a huge number of free courses and guides on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GIMP offers a wide selection of tools and it&rsquo;s a fantastic option if you&rsquo;re looking for a free photo editor similar to Photoshop. The UI is slightly different from Photoshop&rsquo;s but you can modify it to your liking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you find a &ldquo;monstrous&rdquo; program with huge system requirements and a scary price tag unappealing &ndash; GIMP is the option for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pros:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Constant maintenance and updates that solve relevant issues and add new functions</li>\r\n	<li>Smooth performance on all platforms</li>\r\n	<li>Extremely versatile and easily customizable with plugins and scripts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cons:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I didn&rsquo;t experience any problems but heard some people suffer from a couple of bugs</li>\r\n	<li>Doesn&rsquo;t support 16bit color channels</li>\r\n	<li>Some functions are in development for way too long</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Photo Pos Pro</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo Pos Pro is another decent photo editor like Photoshop that strives to be as user-friendly as possible. It has separate modes for beginners and advanced users. In beginner-mode, you can apply filters in a single click and perform basic photo corrections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The professional mode has a UI similar to Photoshop. Most find its interface to be more intuitive and comprehensible than GIMP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alas, this free photo editor like Photoshop has a very serious flaw. The maximum size of saved files is limited to 1024&times;2014 pixels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need to work with larger files, the photo editor will offer you to purchase the paid version for $20. That&rsquo;s a bit unpleasant, but still several times cheaper than Photoshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pros:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Capability to work with layers</li>\r\n	<li>All kinds of brushes, templates, textures and gradients</li>\r\n	<li>Tools for batch, manual and automatic color correction</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cons:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>No way to create your own brushes</li>\r\n	<li>Rather poor printing preparation functionality</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Pixlr Editor</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pixlr Editor is a rather unusual photo editor similar to Photoshop. It&rsquo;s available in several versions, including PC, mobile and as an online editor. The web version is the sole reasonable Photoshop replacement since it&rsquo;s the only one with layer support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, the web version of this program can&rsquo;t be set to full-screen since there will still be unused space on the right. However, that&rsquo;s the only serious drawback of Pixlr Editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All tools found in Ps are available and work great. Overall, this is the perfect photo editor app like Photoshop for situations when you need to edit an image but you don&rsquo;t have the right to install a downloadable editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pros:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Available for free</li>\r\n	<li>Has its own smartphone app</li>\r\n	<li>Plenty of tools to work with</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cons:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Can be slightly overwhelming for beginners</li>\r\n	<li>Requires Internet connection</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Pixelmator</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pixelmator is a universal graphics editor build on the principles of simplicity and accessibility for everyone. The program is available only on iOS and MacOS, which explains such an approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pixelmator positions itself as a photo editor like Photoshop that is simpler and more intuitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of a single workspace, here we have the main window and movable panels that you can open in the View menu or by using shortcuts. The number of picture editing tools isn&rsquo;t large but won&rsquo;t leave you complaining either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also want to mention the smart selection function that was added with the latest update. My subjective experience suggests that this option works better than in Photoshop and is slightly better visible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no need to impose this editor on professionals, but it&rsquo;s a perfect fit for regular users. One of the most &ldquo;magical&rdquo; capabilities of Pixelmator is object removal. You pick the diameter of the selection, add a couple of brush strokes, and the photo will be cleared of any excess objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pros:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Clean user-friendly UI</li>\r\n	<li>Large choice of effects other than photo adjustments</li>\r\n	<li>Drawing tools are efficient and error-free</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cons:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Doesn&rsquo;t offer non-destructive editing or a history panel</li>\r\n	<li>No CMYK and RAW support</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. PaintNet</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Paintnet represents a Windows-based free photo editor like Photoshop supplied by Microsoft. However, don&rsquo;t let that fact scare you: despite being a default program, it&rsquo;s a surprisingly multifunctional and useful tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This option focuses on ease of use and is better suited for photo editing than artistic creations. Nonetheless, it includes a variety of special effects that allow you to easily create an artificial perspective, mix and move pixels on the canvas, select and copy areas, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A solid selection toolset, layer support and such settings as curves and brightness/contrast mean that PaintNet is a wonderful free photo editor similar to Photoshop, especially if you don&rsquo;t need the latest additions to Ps&rsquo; toolset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pros:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Allows working with image layers</li>\r\n	<li>Updates come out almost every month</li>\r\n	<li>Contains a satisfying number of effects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cons:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lack of functions for professional graphics design</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Adobe Photoshop Express</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adobe Photoshop Express can be considered a lighter, more limited version of Photoshop. This editor can be found online or as an app for Windows, iOS and Android. This is the simplest solution described in the article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have layer support, plugins or brushes and works only with JPEG, JPG and JPE images below 16MB. You can&rsquo;t even crop photos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only things you can find in this photo editor app like Photoshop are some basic settings and a collection of beautiful filters that you can use to enhance a photo before posting it on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, it isn&rsquo;t suited for deep photo editing so you might as well go with a trustworthy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fixthephoto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">professional photo editing service online</a>&nbsp;instead for a couple of backs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pros:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Incredibly easy to use</li>\r\n	<li>Availability of basic tools</li>\r\n	<li>Stable performance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cons:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lack of most professional tools</li>\r\n	<li>No RAW support</li>\r\n	<li>Max file size of 16MB</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you ever start thinking about replacing Photoshop, I hope you&rsquo;ll take note of some of the offered programs. If you need to perform complex image editing that requires using many different tools, then Affinity Photo, GIMP or Pixelmator are perfectly suited for such a task.

(28, 'Prerequisites For Machine Learning.', 'Anonymous', 'prerequisites-for-machine-learning', '<p>Machine Learning has rightly become one of the most popular technologies around and according to&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;researchers, every single thing ranging from our food, to our jobs, to the software we write will be affected by it. And if you are a beginner looking to build a career in this field, it&rsquo;s necessary that you understand the prerequisites for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2017/11/introduction-machine-learning.html\" target=\"_blank\">Machine Learning</a>. But this knowledge about prerequisites for Machine Learning is not only for freshers in the field but also for anyone who owns or is looking to start a business! Confused?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, If businesses don&rsquo;t understand the importance of Machine Learning soon enough, they will experience a world of trouble. In the future, the emergence of Machine Learning will be hailed as a very significant milestone. Machine Learning, which is a part of AI, enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. And today, Machine Learning has established itself as the key to unlocking the value of customer data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook&rsquo;s ability to recognize our faces, Netflix&rsquo;s movie recommendations, Google&rsquo;s self-driving cars are early examples of Machine Learning solutions. Given the large untapped potential of this innovation, creating a strategic roadmap can serve well in building Machine Learning capabilities that will definitely help in creating value for your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-machine-learning-ml\" target=\"_blank\">get started with Machine Learning</a>, you require to have little knowledge of the mathematical concepts. Except for the necessary programming efficiency, you also need to be familiar with the basic mathematical theories to fully understand how algorithms function in the background. Here&rsquo;s the list of some principal topics you need to understand before you engage yourself in machine learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article will help you with the different concepts that you need to know before you get started with Machine Learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prerequisites For Machine Learning</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, you must grasp the following concepts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Mathematics</li>\r\n	<li>Statistics</li>\r\n	<li>Probability</li>\r\n	<li>Linear Algebra</li>\r\n	<li>Data Modeling</li>\r\n	<li>Calculus</li>\r\n	<li>Programming Languages</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dig right in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(170, 170, 170); font-style: italic;\">Basic Mathematics</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prime importance of Maths in Machine Learning can&rsquo;t be exaggerated, yet the extent of its usefulness depends upon a particular project. Beginners don&rsquo;t need to grasp it in-depth because you only need to learn the implementation of the algorithms using the given tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be difficult to understand the working of algorithms without proper knowledge about multivariable calculus or linear algebra. And if you desire to make a career in Machine Learning, then you will at some point have to build algorithms yourself. Hence, linear algebra, and multivariable calculus are very important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(170, 170, 170); font-style: italic;\">Statistics</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics deals with applied mathematics concerned with data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation. Machine Learning algorithms are hugely based on statistics. Therefore, it will help you to have some knowledge of statistical theory, like Bayes rule, independence, among others. Statistics uses tools that are used to get an outcome from data. The descriptive statistics that is used to transform raw data into important information. Then there is inferential statistics that is used to get important information from a data sample instead of using a complete dataset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(170, 170, 170); font-style: italic;\">Probability</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probability and Statistics are related fields. Probability is a mathematical method employed for statistical analysis. Hence we can say that probability and statistics are interconnected branches that deal with analysing the relative frequency of events. It is the ratio of desired outcomes to total outcomes:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nDesired Outcomes / Total Outcomes</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to learn probability before diving into Machine Learning because it helps in predicting the likelihood of the occurrences. Therefore, in Machine Learning, probability lays a solid foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(170, 170, 170); font-style: italic;\">Linear Algebra</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Linear algebra deals with vector operations, linear transformations, and matrices. Linear Algebra holds a significant position when it comes to Machine Learning because it can be used to perform operations or transform the dataset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(170, 170, 170); font-style: italic;\">Data Modeling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the process of estimating the structure of a data set. It is used to find out patterns or variations within the set. Major chunk of Machine Learning is usually built on predictive modeling, and therefore with Data Modeling, you would know how to predict different properties of the data. Sometimes, iterative learning algorithms result in magnifying the errors in the set and the model, therefore knowledge of data modeling becomes necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(170, 170, 170); font-style: italic;\">Calculus</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calculus is one of the most significant fields in mathematics as it plays an integral role in many Machine Learning algorithms. Calculus plays an important role in building the Machine Learning Model. Often people working on bleeding edge tools employ calculus, linear algebra, and advanced math routinely in their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#aaaaaa;font-style:italic;\">Programming Language</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before getting into Machine Learning, it is essential that you know programming languages like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2019/04/r-vs-python-for-machine-learning.html\" target=\"_blank\">R and Python</a>&nbsp;in order to implement the whole process. Python and R provide built-in libraries making it easy to implement Machine Learning algorithms. Apart from basic programming knowledge, it is also imperative that you learn how to extract, process and analyze data. Programming Languages is the one of primary skills needed for Machine Learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Machine Learning Can Influence Business</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that the large potential of Machine Learning is still untapped, the following shows different ways in which Machine Learning can benefit a business:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>1. Customization of a User&rsquo;s Experience</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything a person sees can be customized for them. It can even anticipate their needs and behaviors in advance and include personalized recommendations for products or services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>2. Identify Trends, Predict and Estimate on Large Scale</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Machine Learning can identify trends in data well before humans. It can also be used in making predictions that otherwise might require great level of expertise like pricing a home or make impossible predictions such as which content will do well on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>3. Visually Identify Objects and Tailor Experiences Accordingly</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Objects can be identified visually through photos, videos which can be used to automate a customer&rsquo;s experience accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>4. Detect Unusual Activity or System Failure</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Machine Learning can not just detect when an issue arises, but also recognize whether that issue is unusual or alarming. This can be very useful in monitoring and security systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Machine Learning Benefit Businesses</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>1. Help in Expansion Of Business</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The right data can help you recognize new business opportunities and create new products and services for your customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>2. Enhanced User Experience</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Machine Learning quickly and efficiently help you find products and services that will most likely to be relevant for your users. This is bound to enhance the user experience and make your business a profitable one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>3. Help Make Informed Business Decisions</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Machine Learning can save your time and money by making your investments more effective through scientific methods</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where To Begin?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The very first step would be of hiring the right talent for the job. And better still you can any day outsource all this to a team that can actually make this all work for you and help you meet your business objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#aaaaaa;font-style:italic;\">Web Development Services:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can hire a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://squareboat.com/services/web-development\" target=\"_blank\">Web Development company</a>&nbsp;that can fulfill all your requirements related to business website. Look for a company that can handle the building of all kinds of static or dynamic, responsive or an e-commerce site.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#aaaaaa;font-style:italic;\">App Development Services:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To cater to your App Development needs hire a team of professional app developers who can build a perfect mobile app as per your business requirements and demands. Look for a team that can build professional mobile applications for all platforms including iOS and Android.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#aaaaaa;font-style:italic;\">Chatbot Services:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A chatbot can help any business increase its reach and traffic. It is a virtual assistant that can be integrated within an app, website or messenger. Hire a team of professionals who have in the past successfully built several such conversational agents and is willing to design an exclusive Chatbot which incorporates all your personal business needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#aaaaaa;font-style:italic;\">Growth Hacking:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For a successful enterprise, it is important that your business organization makes growth in the right direction.

(29, 'Cloud Computing – Overview, Types, Benefits and Future Scope', 'ASHUTOSH RANJAN', 'what-is-cloud-computing', '<p>Cloud Computing is a type of online on-demand service that includes resources like computer system software, databases, storage, applications, and other computing resources over the internet without any use of physical components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, a remote system that helps you to access application, software, and databases from any device via internet connection is known as &ldquo;Cloud Computing&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why Cloud Computing is more efficient? Here are the three ways which makes Cloud Computing a better option than any traditional web hosting:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>It as on-demand service type, which means it is sold on the demand of user particularly by the hour or a minute</li>\r\n	<li>Flexibility to users from selecting as much and as little of a service according to the requirement at any given point of time</li>\r\n	<li>Users requires only the computer system and internet connection and rest is managed by the service provider</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These are three main applications of Cloud Computing which makes it more efficient and a powerful service to rely upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cloud Computing History</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When we see the dates back in 1950s and 1960s, it was not easier for employees as it is now in current scenario. There were some large mainstreams hardware infrastructure installed which we call as &ldquo;Server Room&rdquo;. Through these large server rooms employees could only access work files, messages, or a system software for work via physical cables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now imagine, if you are working in that scenario and you have to work in a place where everything is to be done manually. You have to install software manually, import data using physical cables, and if any of the component crashes, it could be catastrophic for complete system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of &ldquo;Cloud Computing&rdquo; started emerging from 1970s when IBM introduced an operating system called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/virtual-machines\" target=\"_blank\">VM (Virtual Machines)</a>. The idea of beginning with VM allowed multiple virtual machines on a single node that reduced maintaining of such large mainframes for each user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, Cloud Computing has evolved through many phases from mainframes to virtualization in Cloud. If you want to read a complete history of Cloud Computing, check out the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/cloud-computing-history\" target=\"_blank\">IBM&rsquo;s blogpost on Cloud history</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Cloud Computing Eliminated Former Working Pattern?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It has changed the complete pattern of working environment by eliminating former office culture in following ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Large servers were no longer required by IT companies and businesses to house them in a well-ventilated room.</li>\r\n	<li>No risk of information loss as companies can now store data directly on Cloud with multiple safeguard options without any vulnerability of loosing data from any physical device.</li>\r\n	<li>Duplicate versions of document wiped out with the help of shared access cloud-based files where data is always up to date. Team of Employees don&rsquo;t have to manage multiple versions of files they are working on.</li>\r\n	<li>No need of dedicated in-house IT support to large companies as manual updating and installation of software has been eliminated completely.</li>\r\n	<li>Fixed working place for employees has also been vanished as now employees can work remotely too with cloud-based services.</li>\r\n	<li>Large amount of cost involved in installing and maintaining applications of each device was reduced to great extent. This was much beneficial for small and mid-scale enterprises.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cloud Computing Types</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cloud Computing services are broadly divided into three categories depending on the type of resources being delivered:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic\">1. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>SaaS is a type of cloud-based software or services that delivers complete application over the internet which can be run on distant computers in the Cloud. There is no need to download or install the software on each individual device. The software is entirely managed by the service provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"marker\">For example:</span>&nbsp; software like Salesforce CRM dashboard, Quickbooks, Google Apps, Slack, Mint, etc. can be used directly on the cloud and can be customized according to user needs without any coding or programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic\">2. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>IaaS is suitable for those companies who require computing resources like servers, firewall, data center, and storage capacity. It is the most open-ended type of service which lets businesses perform a lot of customizations themselves. The best part &ndash; there is no need of large fund investments as businesses can hire IT resources and infrastructure for fast pace growth and development provided by IaaS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"marker\">For example:</span>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Amazon Web services, Rackspace, GCE, Digital Ocean, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic\">3. Platform-as-a-Service</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>PaaS lets you focus on software building, hosting, and testing at a faster and low-cost rate. It provides development tools like servers, code libraries, programming interface, etc. without taking any concerns for back-end such as security and infrastructure. PaaS allows multiple users to work on the same application simultaneously. Ultimately with PaaS, one can develop application without any coding skills with drag-drop intuitiveness, deploy new web applications to the cloud in minutes, and reduce complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"marker\">For example:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft Azure, Open Shift, Apache Stratos, Heroku, Beanstalk, Magento, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Cloud Computing</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Reliable</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>than any traditional web hosting as they are hosted by third parties and in case of any loss or problem, customer support system is easy to access.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Flexible&nbsp;</em>as it can be remotely used from any device and any location with real-time working experience.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Security</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is much higher than ever expected with centralization of data and multiple phases of security.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Scalable</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>as there is no fixed or limited geographic location. Moreover, the software integration with other apps also makes it highly scalable.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Pay per use</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>pricing plans helps businesses to compute resources according to their needs and pay only for that.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Multitenancy</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>feature provides the opportunity of sharing resources to multiple users at given point of time.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Customizable</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>cloud software allows users to adapt to the programs ad applications that are customizable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future of Cloud Computing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The future of Cloud Computing is embracing many advances and high-end capabilities with the help of modern technologies like IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence). Small and mid-scale enterprises are likely to combine multi-cloud services from different service providers which will change the way of doing possible work. Expansion of Cloud adoption by almost every business type will enhance the smart workflows and less dependency on outsiders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><em>Final Thoughts on Cloud Computing</em></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing is for sure that Cloud adoption will increase day by day for providing benefits to the businesses as well as consumers alike. Technologies will improve faster and they too would require Cloud for managing and simplifying their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will likely be more integration in real-word technologies like modes of transportation, smart elevators, automation in restaurants, self-driving cars, etc. Cloud Computing will become necessary for every type of business work and requirements.</p>\r\n', 'cloud-computing.jpg', '2019-11-23 03:00:05', 4, 63),
(34, 'Advice for every Computer Science college students', 'Joel Spolsky', 'advice-for-computer-science-college-students', '<p>Despite the fact that it was only a year or two ago that I was blubbering about how rich Windows GUI clients were the wave of the future, college students nonetheless do occasionally email me asking for career advice, and since it&rsquo;s recruiting season, I thought I&rsquo;d write up my standard advice which they can read, laugh at, and ignore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most college students, fortunately, are brash enough never to bother asking their elders for advice, which, in the field of computer science, is a good thing, because their elders are apt to say goofy, antediluvian things like &ldquo;the demand for keypunch operators will exceed 100,000,000 by the year 2010&rdquo; and &ldquo;lisp careers are really very hot right now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I, too, have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about when I give advice to college students. I&rsquo;m so hopelessly out of date that I can&rsquo;t really figure out AIM and still use (horrors!) this quaint old thing called &ldquo;email&rdquo; which was popular in the days when music came on flat round plates called &ldquo;CDs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you&rsquo;d be better off ignoring what I&rsquo;m saying here and instead building some kind of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thefacebook.com/\">online software thing</a>&nbsp;that lets other students find people to go out on dates with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoy programming computers, count your blessings: you are in a very fortunate minority of people who can make a great living doing work they enjoy. Most people aren&rsquo;t so lucky. The very idea that you can &ldquo;love your job&rdquo; is a modern concept. Work is supposed to be something unpleasant you do to get money to do the things you actually like doing, when you&rsquo;re 65 and can finally retire, if you can afford it, and if you&rsquo;re not too old and infirm to do those things, and if those things don&rsquo;t require reliable knees, good eyes, and the ability to walk twenty feet without being out of breath, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What was I talking about? Oh yeah. Advice.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without further ado, then, here are Joel&rsquo;s Seven Pieces of Free Advice for Computer Science College Students (worth what you paid for them):</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Learn how to write before graduating.</li>\r\n	<li>Learn C before graduating.</li>\r\n	<li>Learn microeconomics before graduating.</li>\r\n	<li>Don&rsquo;t blow off non-CS classes just because they&rsquo;re boring.</li>\r\n	<li>Take programming-intensive courses.</li>\r\n	<li>Stop worrying about all the jobs going to India.</li>\r\n	<li>No matter what you do, get a good summer internship.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Now for the explanations, unless you&rsquo;re gullible enough to do all that stuff just because I tell you to, in which case add: 8. Seek professional help for that self-esteem thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Learn how to write before graduating.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Would Linux have succeeded if Linus Torvalds hadn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1991Oct5.054106.4647%40klaava.Helsinki.FI\">evangelized</a>&nbsp;it? As brilliant a hacker as he is, it was Linus&rsquo;s ability to convey his ideas in written English via email and mailing lists that made Linux attract a worldwide brigade of volunteers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you heard of the latest fad, Extreme Programming? Well, without getting into what I think about XP, the reason you&rsquo;ve heard of it is because it is being promoted by people who are very gifted writers and speakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even on the small scale, when you look at any programming organization, the programmers with the most power and influence are the ones who can write and speak in English clearly, convincingly, and comfortably. Also it helps to be tall, but you can&rsquo;t do anything about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming languages they know, and it&rsquo;s not&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html\">whether they prefer Python or Java</a>. It&rsquo;s whether they can communicate their ideas. By persuading other people, they get leverage. By writing clear comments and technical specs, they let other programmers understand their code, which means other programmers can use and work with their code instead of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html\">rewriting it</a>. Absent this, their code is worthless. By writing clear technical documentation for end users, they allow people to figure out what their code is supposed to do, which is the only way those users can see the value in their code. There&rsquo;s a lot of wonderful, useful code buried on sourceforge somewhere that nobody uses because it was created by programmers who don&rsquo;t write very well (or don&rsquo;t write at all), and so nobody knows what they&rsquo;ve done and their brilliant code languishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I won&rsquo;t hire a programmer unless they can write, and write well, in English. If you can write, wherever you get hired, you&rsquo;ll soon find that you&rsquo;re getting asked to write the specifications and that means you&rsquo;re already leveraging your influence and getting noticed by management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most colleges designate certain classes as &ldquo;writing intensive,&rdquo; meaning, you have to write an awful lot to pass them. Look for those classes and take them! Seek out classes in any field that have weekly or daily written assignments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start a journal or weblog. The more you write, the easier it will be, and the easier it is to write, the more you&rsquo;ll write, in a virtuous circle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Learn C before graduating</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Part two: C. Notice I didn&rsquo;t say C++. Although C is becoming increasingly rare, it is still the lingua franca of working programmers. It is the language they use to communicate with one another, and, more importantly, it is much closer to the machine than &ldquo;modern&rdquo; languages that you&rsquo;ll be taught in college like ML, Java, Python, whatever trendy junk they teach these days. You need to spend at least a semester getting close to the machine or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000319.html\">you&rsquo;ll never be able to create efficient code in higher level languages.</a>&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll never be able to work on compilers and operating systems, which are some of the best programming jobs around. You&rsquo;ll never be trusted to create architectures for large scale projects. I don&rsquo;t care how much you know about continuations and closures and exception handling: if you can&rsquo;t explain why&nbsp;<strong>while (*s++ = *t++);</strong>&nbsp;copies a string, or if that isn&rsquo;t the most natural thing in the world to you, well, you&rsquo;re programming based on superstition, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned: a medical doctor who doesn&rsquo;t know basic anatomy, passing out prescriptions based on what the pharma sales babe said would work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Learn microeconomics before graduating</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Super quick review if you haven&rsquo;t taken any economics courses: econ is one of those fields that starts off with a bang, with many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html\">useful theories and facts</a>&nbsp;that make sense, can be proven in the field, etc., and then&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html\">it&rsquo;s all downhill from there</a>. The useful bang at the beginning is microeconomics, which is the foundation for literally every theory in business that matters. After that things start to deteriorate: you get into Macroeconomics (feel free to skip this if you want) with its interesting theories about things like the relationship of interest rates to unemployment which, er, seem to be disproven more often than they are proven, and after that it just gets worse and worse and a lot of econ majors switch out to Physics, which gets them better Wall Street jobs, anyway. But make sure you take Microeconomics, because you have to know about supply and demand, you have to know about competitive advantage, and you have to understand NPVs and discounting and marginal utility before you&rsquo;ll have any idea why business works the way it does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why should CS majors learn econ? Because a programmer who understands the fundamentals of business is going to be a more valuable programmer, to a business, than a programmer who doesn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s all there is to it. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve been frustrated by programmers with crazy ideas that make sense in code but don&rsquo;t make sense in capitalism. If you understand this stuff, you&rsquo;re a more valuable programmer, and you&rsquo;ll get rewarded for it, for reasons which you&rsquo;ll also learn in micro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Don&rsquo;t blow off non-CS classes just because they&rsquo;re boring.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Blowing off your non-CS courses is a great way to get a lower GPA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Never underestimate how big a deal your GPA is. Lots and lots of recruiters and hiring managers, myself included, go straight to the GPA when they scan a resume, and we&rsquo;re not going to apologize for it. Why? Because the GPA, more than any other one number, reflects the sum of what dozens of professors over a long period of time in many different situations think about your work. SAT scores? Ha! That&rsquo;s one test over a few hours. The GPA reflects hundreds of papers and midterms and classroom participations over four years. Yeah, it&rsquo;s got its problems. There has been grade inflation over the years. Nothing about your GPA says whether you got that GPA taking easy classes in home economics at Podunk Community College or taking graduate level Quantum Mechanics at Caltech. Eventually, after I screen out all the 2.5 GPAs from Podunk Community, I&rsquo;m going to ask for transcripts and recommendations. And then I&rsquo;m going to look for&nbsp;<em>consistently</em>&nbsp;high grades, not just high grades in computer science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why should I, as an employer looking for software developers, care about what grade you got in European History? After all, history is&nbsp;<em>boring.&nbsp;</em>Oh, so, you&rsquo;re saying I should hire you because you don&rsquo;t work very hard when the work is boring? Well, there&rsquo;s boring stuff in programming, too. Every job has its boring moments. And I don&rsquo;t want to hire people that only want to do the fun stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I took this course in college called Cultural Anthropology because I figured, what the heck, I need to learn&nbsp;<em>something</em>&nbsp;about anthropology, and this looked like an interesting survey course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interesting? Not even close! I had to read these incredibly monotonous books about Indians in the Brazilian rain forest and Trobriand Islanders, who, with all due respect, are not very interesting to me. At some point, the class was so incredibly wearisome that I longed for something more exciting, like&nbsp;<em>watching grass grow</em>. I had completely lost interest in the subject matter. Completely, and thoroughly. My&nbsp;<em>eyes teared</em>&nbsp;I was so tired of the endless discussions of piling up yams. I don&rsquo;t know why the Trobriand Islanders spend so much time piling up yams, I can&rsquo;t remember any more, it&rsquo;s incredibly boring, but It Was Going To Be On The Midterm, so I plowed through it. I eventually decided that Cultural Anthropology was going to be my Boredom Gauntlet: my personal obstacle course of tedium. If I could get an A in a class where the tests required me to learn all about potlatch blankets, I could handle anything, no matter how boring. The next time I accidentally get stuck in Lincoln Center sitting through all 18 hours of Wagner&rsquo;s Ring Cycle, I could thank my studies of the Kwakiutl for making it seem pleasant by comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got an A. And if I could do it, you can do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Take programming-intensive courses.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember the exact moment I vowed never to go to graduate school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in a course on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/dynamic_logic.html\">Dynamic Logic</a>, taught by the dynamic Lenore Zuck at Yale, one of the brightest of an array of very bright CS faculty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, my murky recollections are not going to do proper credit to this field, but let me muddle through anyway. The idea of Formal Logic is that you prove things are true because other things are true. For example thanks to Formal Logic, &ldquo;Everyone who gets good grades will get hired&rdquo; plus &ldquo;Johnny got good grades&rdquo; allows you to discover the new true fact, &ldquo;Johnny will get hired.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s all very quaint and it only takes ten seconds for a deconstructionist to totally tear apart everything useful in Formal Logic so you&rsquo;re left with something fun, but useless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now,&nbsp;<em>dynamic</em>&nbsp;logic is the same thing, with the addition of time. For example, &ldquo;<em>after</em>&nbsp;you turn the light on, you can see your shoes&rdquo; plus &ldquo;The light went on in the past&rdquo; implies &ldquo;you can see your shoes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dynamic Logic is appealing to brilliant theoreticians like Professor Zuck because it holds up the hope that you might be able to&nbsp;<em>formally</em>&nbsp;prove things about computer programs, which could be very useful, if, for example, you could formally prove that the Mars Rover&rsquo;s flash card wouldn&rsquo;t overflow and cause itself to be rebooted again and again all day long when it&rsquo;s supposed to be driving around the red planet looking for Marvin the Martian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So in the first day of that class, Dr. Zuck filled up two entire whiteboards and quite a lot of the wall&nbsp;<em>next to</em>&nbsp;the whiteboards proving that if you have a light switch, and the light was off, and you flip the switch, the light will then be on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proof was insanely complicated, and very error-prone. It was harder to prove that the&nbsp;<em>proof</em>&nbsp;was correct than to convince yourself of the fact that switching a light switch turns on the light. Indeed the multiple whiteboards of proof included many skipped steps, skipped because they were too tedious to go into formally. Many steps were reached using the long-cherished method of Proof by Induction, others by Proof by Reductio ad Absurdum, and still others using Proof by Graduate Student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our homework, we had to prove the converse:&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;the light was off,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;it&rsquo;s on now, prove that you flipped it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried, I really did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spent hours in the library trying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a couple of hours I found a mistake in Dr. Zuck&rsquo;s original proof which I was trying to emulate. Probably I copied it down wrong, but it made me realize something: if it takes three hours of filling up blackboards to prove something trivial, allowing hundreds of opportunities for mistakes to slip in, this mechanism would never be able to prove things that are&nbsp;<em>interesting</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not that that matters to dynamic logicians: they&rsquo;re not in it for&nbsp;<em>useful,</em>&nbsp;they&rsquo;re in it for tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I dropped the class and vowed never to go to graduate school in Computer Science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The moral of the story is that computer science is not the same as software development. If you&rsquo;re really really lucky, your school might have a decent software development curriculum, although, they might not, because elite schools think that teaching practical skills is better left to the technical-vocational institutes and the prison rehabilitation programs. You can learn mere&nbsp;<em>programming</em>&nbsp;anywhere. We are Yale University, and we Mold Future World Leaders. You think your $160,000 tuition entititles you to learn about&nbsp;<em>while loops?</em>&nbsp;What do you think this is, some fly-by-night&nbsp;<em>Java seminar</em>&nbsp;at the Airport Marriott? Pshaw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trouble is, we don&rsquo;t really have professional schools in software development, so if you want to be a programmer, you probably majored in Computer Science. Which is a fine subject to major in, but it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<em>different subject</em>&nbsp;than software development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky, though, you can find lots of programming-intensive courses in the CS department, just like you can find lots of courses in the History department where you&rsquo;ll write enough to learn how to write. And those are the best classes to take. If you love programming, don&rsquo;t feel bad if you don&rsquo;t understand the point of those courses in lambda calculus or linear algebra where you never touch a computer. Look for the 400-level courses with Practicum in the name. This is an attempt to hide a useful (<em>shudder</em>) course from the Liberal Artsy Fartsy Administration by dolling it up with a Latin name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Stop worrying about all the jobs going to India.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, OK, first of all, if you&rsquo;re already&nbsp;<em>in&nbsp;</em>India, you never really had to worry about this, so don&rsquo;t even&nbsp;<em>start&nbsp;</em>worrying about all the jobs going to India. They&rsquo;re wonderful jobs, enjoy them in good health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I keep hearing that enrollment in CS departments is dropping perilously, and one reason I hear for it is &ldquo;students are afraid to go into a field where all the jobs are going to India.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s so wrong for so many reasons. First, trying to choose a career based on a current business fad is foolish. Second, programming is incredibly good training for all kinds of fabulously interesting jobs, such as business process engineering, even if every single programming job does go to India and China. Third, and trust me on this, there&rsquo;s still an incredible shortage of the really good programmers, here&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;in India. Yes, there are a bunch of out of work IT people making a lot of noise about how long they&rsquo;ve been out of work, but you know what? At the risk of pissing them off, really good programmers&nbsp;<em>do&nbsp;</em>have jobs. Fourth, you got any better ideas? What are you going to do, major in History? Then you&rsquo;ll have no choice but to go to law school. And there&rsquo;s one thing I do know: 99% of working lawyers&nbsp;<em>hate</em>&nbsp;their jobs, hate every waking minute of it, and they&rsquo;re working 90 hour weeks, too. Like I said: if you love to program computers, count your blessings: you are in a very fortunate minority of people who can make a great living doing work they love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t think students really think about this. The drop in CS enrollment is merely a resumption of historically normal levels after a big bubble in enrollment caused by dotcom mania. That bubble consisted of people who didn&rsquo;t really like programming but thought the sexy high paid jobs and the chances to IPO at age 24 were to be found in the CS department. Those people, thankfully, are long gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>No matter what you do, get a good summer internship.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Smart recruiters know that the people who love programming wrote a database for their dentist in 8th grade, and taught at computer camp for three summers before college, and built the content management system for the campus newspaper, and had summer internships at software companies. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re looking for on your resume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoy programming, the biggest mistake you can make is to take any kind of job&ndash;summer, part time, or otherwise&ndash;that is not a programming job. I know, every other 19-year-old wants to work in the mall folding shirts, but you have a skill that is incredibly valuable even when you&rsquo;re 19, and it&rsquo;s foolish to waste it folding shirts. By the time you graduate, you really should have a resume that lists a whole bunch of programming jobs. The A&amp;F graduates are going to be working at Enterprise Rent-a-Car &ldquo;helping people with their rental needs.&rdquo; (Except for Tom Welling. He plays Superman on TV.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make your life really easy, and to underscore just how completely self-serving this whole essay is, my company, Fog Creek Software, has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fogcreek.com/Jobs/SummerIntern.html\">summer internships in software development</a>&nbsp;that look&nbsp;<em>great</em>&nbsp;on resumes. &ldquo;You will most likely learn more about software coding, development, and business with Fog Creek Software than any other internship out there,&rdquo; says Ben, one of the interns from last summer, and not entirely because I sent a goon out to his dorm room to get him to say that. The application deadline is February 1st. Get on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you follow my advice, you, too, may end up selling stock in Microsoft way too soon, turning down jobs at Google because you want your own office with a door, and other stupid life decisions, but they won&rsquo;t be my fault. I told you not to listen to me.</p>\r\n', 'cs.jpg', '2019-11-23 04:01:25', 5, 42),
